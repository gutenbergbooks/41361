<h2>CHAPTER I</h2>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1" id="Page_1">1</a></span></p>
<p class="ptitle">THE WIDOW PICKLE'S TWINS AND THEIR PECULIAR HAIR</p>

<p>Once, several years ago, there lived in a city far from
the sea-shore a widow by the name of Mrs. Pickle, who
had Twins named Zuzu Pickle and Lulu Pickle.
At first glance, these Twins seemed much like ordinary
twins in appearance. Both had blue eyes, pretty curved
lips, and rosy cheeks; and as they were quite alike in size,
it may seem that, like many other twins, they must have
been hard to tell apart. Such, however, was not the
case. Indeed, they could not well be confused with each
other, for, aside from the fact that Zuzu was a boy and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">2</a></span>Lulu a girl, one had green hair and the other blue. This
peculiar color of their hair made them quite different from
most twins, and led to a great many strange circumstances,
some of which are described in this story.</p>

<p>The father of these Twins was Aurelius Pickle, an
innocent and good man, who for many years was known
as a very skilful chemist. Like many other chemists,
he wasted a great deal of time in doing things which did
not bring in any money. For instance, he worked many
years on a compound intended to change a person's hair
from any color to a rich, dark brown or to a deep and
shining auburn, at will. Aurelius Pickle was a poor
man, and hence did not have the means for his researches
that he desired. He often told his wife that it was fortunate
they had Twins with such long hair, for thus he
could make all the experiments for the Twofold-tint
Compound, which was what he intended to call the hair-coloring
fluid on which he was working. Whenever he
made a new kettleful of this, he would try it on the long
rich hair of the Twins.</p>

<p>At last he hit upon two new mixtures, one or the other
of which he felt sure would be just the thing. He tried
one on the hair of Lulu and the other on that of Zuzu.
To his great surprise, the hair of Zuzu became a fine pale
green, while that of Lulu turned at the same time to a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">3</a></span>pale blue, much the color of the ribbons around the neck
of a new baby.</p>

<p>The Twins, seeing themselves in the glass, were much
pleased with their appearance, and said they felt sure
no one in town had hair like theirs; which in all likelihood
was true. With their father, however, it was quite otherwise.
Indeed, what he thought was never fully known.
He was taken suddenly ill, and sank back upon his
couch, where he rapidly became worse, and could get no
further than to ask his children to call their mother.
When she appeared, Aurelius Pickle smiled feebly and
motioned her toward the cupboard where he kept his
Chemical Substances. He could do no more.</p>

<p>This, in brief, is how there came to be such a person
as the Widow Pickle. It is not unusual for widows to
have Twins, but seldom could be found such Twins as
these.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER II</h2>

<p class="ptitle">THE WIDOW PICKLE'S STRANGE VISITOR</p>

<p>So badly did the Widow Pickle feel over the peculiar
color of her Twins' hair that for a long time she forgot to
obey her husband's last wish and look in the cupboard.
At last, however, she bethought herself of this request
and hastened to the place where Aurelius Pickle had kept
his Chemical Substances.</p>

<p>She found several strange-looking boxes, with all sorts
of powders and pastes in them, but with no names on
the backs to tell what were their contents. She feared
to make any experiments, lest she might stain her
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">5</a></span>own hair either blue or green or some other unfashionable
color; so all she could do was to look and wonder what
was in the boxes. After several days, she concluded to
mix some different powders together. She took one small
box with a red cover and another that had a black cover,
and, pouring small portions of the powder from each of
these on a plate, she began to stir the two together.</p>

<p>Nothing happened for some moments. "Chemistry
is rather hard, after all," said the Widow Pickle to herself.
"I thought that all there was to it was stirring
things together. I formerly noticed that when my poor
dear husband did that, something nearly always happened."</p>

<p>At last, disappointed that nothing had happened, she
went to the match-box. "Perhaps," said she, "if I touch
a match to it something will happen." She did so, and,
to her great surprise, something did happen, and that
at once.</p>

<p>A cloud of heavy vapor filled the room, and as it
cleared away the Widow Pickle saw standing there, bowing
and smiling very pleasantly, a little dark man, whom
at first she took to be a Japanese. He had black hair,
rolled very tight on the top of his head; small feet,
incased in boots with long up-turned toes; and a loose
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">6</a></span>flowing mantle of red satin. His hands were small, and
his little black eyes twinkled merrily.</p>

<p>"Madam, I believe you have sent for me," he remarked.</p>

<p>"Indeed, I did not," said the Widow Pickle. "Moreover,
I don't know who you are. Whence do you come,
sir, and why do you intrude without invitation?"</p>

<p>"Who should I be," said the little man, still smiling
pleasantly, "but the Private Secretary and Court Musician
of the royal monarch of the Island, the King of Gee-Whiz?"</p>

<p>"The King of Gee-Whiz?" said the Widow Pickle.
"I never heard of such a person."</p>

<p>"Then, madam," replied the little man sternly, "grant
me leave to tell you that you must be an extraordinarily
ignorant person. Every one of consequence knows of
his Royal Highness, who rules our Island."</p>

<p>"And, pray, what do you have in your Island, little
man?" asked the Widow Pickle scornfully.</p>

<p>"Many things," replied the strange little man, "more
than I should like to tell you all at once."</p>

<p>"Gold, perhaps?" asked the Widow.</p>

<p>"I believe it is called gold&mdash;a very common metal,
indeed."</p>

<p>"Pray, then, what do you use for rings?" asked the
Widow, hiding her hands under her apron.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">7</a></span>"We usually make them out of our smaller diamonds,"
replied the little man carelessly. "There are, however,
more precious stones. For instance, there is Lapis
Malazite, a very fashionable blue gem; and Lapis Corazine,
an emerald-green jewel. Blue and green, madam,
are our favorite colors."</p>

<p>"How strange!" exclaimed the Widow Pickle. And
then she told of the manner in which the hair of her
Twins had been permanently colored by some of her husband's
Chemical Substances.</p>

<p>"That is very singular," said the little man. "All I
can say is that if their hair is the real malazite blue and
the correct corazine green, they could have anything
they like in the Land of Gee-Whiz; for these are the
Royal Hereditary Colors. But, really, I must be going.
I rarely ever stay away more than an hour at a time."</p>

<p>As he spoke, he stepped toward the window, but in
doing so he gave his mantle a slight twitch to one side.
As he did this, he displayed to the curious gaze of the
Widow Pickle a strangely-carved Banjo, whose supporting
ribbon was swung over his shoulders. The Banjo was
of ivory and gold, and the pegs for tightening the strings
were of shining gold.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">8</a></span></p>
<p>"Stay!" cried the Widow. "I have never seen so
beautiful an instrument as that. I am sure you play
it well; and as for me, I dote upon the banjo."</p>

<p>"Madam," smiled the little man, "I see your taste is
excellent."</p>

<h2>CHAPTER III</h2>

<p class="ptitle">THE ENCHANTED BANJO</p>

<p>The Widow Pickle asked the stranger to allow her to
examine the Banjo, and he did so willingly. About this
time, the Twins, Lulu and Zuzu, ran into the room; and
very soon they were leaning at their mother's knee, with
their chins in their hands, ready to listen to the music.
At first, the stranger did not look at them intently, but
when he did so he started back with an exclamation of
surprise. At that moment, also, something strange
seemed to happen in the Banjo. The Widow Pickle
looked down at it suddenly. She felt the strings move
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">10</a></span>beneath her fingers. At this, she arose and almost flung
the instrument upon the table. To her great surprise,
it began playing gaily and cheerfully, just as well, and,
indeed, perhaps better, than it would have done had it
been operated by the Widow Pickle herself. The song
which the Banjo sang was something like this:</p>

<p class="ptitle">MALAZITE BLUE AND CORAZINE GREEN</p>
<div class="poetry"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">O, Malazite Blue and Corazine Green!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Such wonderful colors I never have seen,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Except, in the sky<br /></span>
<span class="i2">At a million miles high<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Is the Malazite Blue for delighting the eye.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">And Corazine Green is splendidly fair<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When tinting the ringlets and curls of your hair&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">It comes, if you please,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">From the leaves of the trees<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When they are made bright by the brush of the breeze.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Oh, barrels and barrels of Malazite Blue,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And barrels of Corazine Green, it is true<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Are used every year<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Just to keep the sky clear<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And to tint all the leaves when they have to appear.<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>"Well, I never heard anything in the world like that,"
said the Widow Pickle. "An Enchanted Banjo, that can
play by itself! Surely, this house is haunted, my children,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">11</a></span>since your poor father died! But what a situation
for a lone widow to be in here in a great city, with blue- and
green-haired Twins, an utter stranger, and an Enchanted
Banjo, which plays by itself, and sings about
the peculiar hair of my dear Twins! I always said
that your poor dear father, although good, was not a
practical man."</p>

<p>She looked at the Banjo as it lay upon the table. To
her great surprise, she saw it take itself apart before
her eyes. It lay there in two pieces, the neck quite apart
from the head. Of course, in that position it ceased playing,
and, indeed, one could have expected nothing else,
for even an Enchanted Banjo can not play when it is in
two pieces.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IV</h2>

<p class="ptitle">THE SEARCH IN THE CUPBOARD</p>

<p>Now, presently, a very strange thing happened. The
Twins, Lulu and Zuzu, stood at the edge of the table
grieving very much that the Banjo was broken. Each
put out a hand, Lulu touching the neck of the instrument,
where, in her opinion, the music was, and Zuzu
the round part or head, where he thought that the music
was situated. To their great surprise, as they did this
the Banjo again began to play, the two parts joining
themselves together as good as new. So long as they
held it in this way, it played the most beautiful and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">13</a></span>wonderful music. Stranger still, after it had finished
playing, it began also to talk.</p>

<p>"I am the Enchanted Banjo of the King of Gee-Whiz,"
it said in a small, distinct, and quite unmistakable
voice. "I only take myself apart to rest myself; but
if you put me together again, of course I feel obliged
to play for you, as that is only common politeness on my
part."</p>

<p>"Is that indeed the truth, sir?" asked the Widow
Pickle of the little dark man.</p>

<p>"It is," said he; "and I myself am the Court Musician,
as I have said. It is my duty to furnish music for the
King every day at half-past two in the afternoon, and I
find a self-playing instrument a great convenience. Now,
I am sorry to disturb you, but, by the way, it is nearly
time for us to be returning."</p>

<p>"Excuse me, my children," remarked the Enchanted
Banjo, "but you are holding my neck very tight."</p>

<p>At this, Lulu and Zuzu released their hold, and with a
sigh of relief the Banjo again lay in two pieces on the
table.</p>

<p>"Now, children, see what you have done!" exclaimed
the Widow Pickle. "The Banjo is broken again."</p>

<p>"Never mind," said the Private Secretary, "it will
always play when the two hold it together. Besides,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">14</a></span>it can not resist the Royal Hereditary Colors, madam, for
these are very powerful in our Island."</p>

<p>"In truth," said the Widow Pickle, "I am of a mind
myself to go to this wonderful place of which you talk.
I would like to seek my fortune and that of my Twins.
Have you credibly informed me that Twins with malazite-and
corazine-colored hair would have a good chance in
that country?"</p>

<p>"I have told you the truth," said the little dark man;
"but I must say it is very far from here to the Island of
Gee-Whiz, some hundreds of thousands of miles across
the seas."</p>

<p>"Then, sir, how did you come here yourself?"</p>

<p>"I came by the Gee-Whiz Submarine Express," replied
the Private Secretary. "How else should I come?"</p>

<p>"Alas! I don't know what you mean," said the Widow
Pickle at this.</p>

<p>"Not know, madam? Why, you have all the means
for summoning the Submarine Express directly at your
command."</p>

<p>"Where? where?" asked the Widow excitedly.</p>

<p>The little man pointed at the cupboard where the late
Aurelius Pickle had been accustomed to keep his Chemical
Substances.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">15</a></span>"Why, to be sure," said the Widow Pickle, "it must
be in the cupboard, for it was there I found the two
strange powders which went off with a flash."</p>

<p>By this time, the Twins were dancing around the room
in excitement, running toward the cupboard, which had
never seemed so full of interest before, even in their
hungriest moments.</p>

<p>"Are you ready for your journey, madam?" asked the
Private Secretary.</p>

<p>"I declare, I've more than half a mind to learn what all
this means," said the Widow Pickle.</p>

<p>"Get us ready for the journey, mamma," cried the
Twins, as though it were all settled.</p>

<p>"Very well," said the Widow, "we may as well be prepared
for anything that may happen. First let me comb
your Royal Hereditary Hair. Lulu, go fetch me the blue
comb, and you, Zuzu, get the pale-green one, on top of
the dresser, at the right hand as you go in. I can
not help feeling," said the Widow Pickle, as she combed
the long, wavy hair of her two children, "as though
something was going to happen."</p>

<p>At that moment the Enchanted Banjo, held once more
by the joyful Twins, began this remarkable song:</p>

<p class="ptitle">

<h2>CHAPTER V</h2>

<p class="ptitle">THE GEE-WHIZ SUBMARINE EXPRESS</p>

<p>The Widow Pickle kept studying over matters and
things as she combed the Twins' hair with the blue and
green combs. She began to think, as a great many
widows do, that after all her husband had perhaps been
a very wonderful man, and better than she had thought
at the time. She wished very much, as many widows do,
that her husband were alive again for a few moments.
She wished to ask him just one more question. We
need not explain what that question would have been, for
any one could guess that it would have been in regard
to Chemical Substances.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">19</a></span>At last, she arose and went to the glass door of the
cupboard and began looking carefully behind the dishes
on the shelves. At length she saw a little box, which
she had not noticed before.</p>

<p>"Aha!" cried the Widow Pickle, "I am sure this is
the powder which you mean. Is it not so, little man?"</p>

<p>The latter refused either to speak or to make any sign.</p>

<p>"I will try it, anyhow," said the Widow Pickle. So
she poured some of the powder from this box upon a plate
and began touching a lighted match to it. To her great
surprise, the powder burst out into a cloud of smoke,
and when the smoke had cleared away, she saw, lying
upon the plate, a small but perfect little ship, the like of
which she had never seen before in all her life. It was
something like a steamboat, except that it was covered
over entirely with glass. At the stern it had a large
wheel, evidently to make it go, and it had other wheels
along the bottom, like feet upon a sofa. Its bow was
curved up and backward sharply, something like the
front of a sled, and its sides were gently rounded so that
it could slip along easily. The deck was quite roofed
over by this curved-glass shield, for what reason the
Widow could not tell. Indeed, although she guessed
at once that this was a boat of some sort, she could not
tell what sort it was.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">20</a></span>"Well, I'd like to know&mdash;" began the Widow Pickle.</p>

<p>"What was it you were about to inquire, my good
woman?" asked the Private Secretary.</p>

<p>"Why, what should I inquire, my good man," replied
the Widow, "if not to ask what is this thing here on the
plate?"</p>

<p>"That, madam," said the Private Secretary, "is a
boat."</p>

<p>"A boat? A boat?"</p>

<p>The Private Secretary nodded.</p>

<p>"Can't you read the name?" he asked.</p>

<p>So the Widow Pickle peered closely through her glasses
and saw that there was a name printed in small shining
letters on one end of the boat. "The Gee-Whiz Submarine
Express!" cried the Widow. "But, alack! how
small it is. Why, it is not as long as my foot, and I was
always thought in my time to have a very small foot,
too!"</p>

<p>The Private Secretary smiled in a knowing manner.</p>

<p>"Perhaps, mamma," said Zuzu, "you have overlooked
something in some other box."</p>

<p>"Zuzu, you have a good mind for one so young,"
said his mother. "I will look in the cupboard again."
So again she began rummaging around, and at length
she found another box, a square one, covered over with
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">21</a></span>dust, showing that it had not been opened for a long
time. The first box had held a pale-blue powder, but
this one was filled nearly to the lid with a light-green
powder. On the top of this box, written in the hand of
Aurelius Pickle, was the inscription, "Magic Powder
of Gee-Whiz." When the Widow Pickle saw this, she
gave an exclamation of joy.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VI</h2>

<p class="ptitle">THE JOURNEY THROUGH THE AIR</p>

<p>"Hurry, hurry, mamma!" cried the Twins. "Let
us go."</p>

<p>"But how can we go?" asked the Widow Pickle of
the Private Secretary, as she stood holding the second
box of powder in her hand.</p>

<p>"I suggest, madam," said the Private Secretary, "that
you might put a little of the first powder, the blue one,
in the engine."</p>

<p>The Widow Pickle placed a pinch of the pale-blue
powder upon a certain portion of the little boat, and, to
her great surprise, it began to grow before her eyes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">23</a></span>It grew and it grew, slowly but steadily, until it was
large enough for either of the Twins to get into. In a
moment more it would have been too large to pass out
of the window; and as the Widow Pickle saw this, she
was about to brush off the rest of the powder.</p>

<p>"Stop!" cried the Private Secretary. "The window
will not make the slightest difference in the world.
Quick, madam! Get in with the second box, or it will
be too late."</p>

<p>Indeed, the engine inside the boat now began to churn,
and a strange, brilliant sort of blue smoke began to hiss
at the spouts near the wheel. The boat, for such it can
be called, began to crawl on its feet across the floor
toward the window. The Private Secretary grasped
the Enchanted Banjo and with a bound sprang into the
boat. The Widow, holding on to the remaining box of
powder, and grasping the Twins also with the other
hand, sprang aboard quickly. The Private Secretary
then snapped down the glass all around.</p>

<p>To her great surprise, the Widow Pickle found the boat
quite large enough for all four of them, and even as she
settled down comfortably in her seat the boat rose slowly
and, with a slight hissing of the strange blue steam at
the wheel, it passed directly out and through the window,
just as though it were not there, and sailed off across the
tops of the tall buildings toward the sea.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">24</a></span>"Oh, Mr. Secretary," cried the Widow Pickle, "how
very much startled I am!"</p>

<p>"Madam," replied the Private Secretary, "there is no
need to be startled. It is very well, however, that you
got the second box from among the Chemical Substances
of the late Aurelius Pickle."</p>

<p>"Why should that be so?" asked the Widow. "You
must remember that I am in the dark about many of
these things. It seems very strange to me to be thus
flying off across the city. For all we know, we may drop
directly into the sea before long."</p>

<p>"That is true," said the Private Secretary, chuckling.
"In fact, that is precisely what we shall do within two
minutes. And that is the reason I am glad you have
the green powder with you. That, you must understand,
is our fuel for water travel; for without that we could not
possibly get up any green steam, and surely you must
know that with a boat of this particular kind, blue steam
may be all very well for the air, but it is of no service
whatever under the water."</p>

<p>"That," said the Widow Pickle, "seems a most singular
thing."</p>

<p>"Many things which now seem strange to you," replied
the Private Secretary, "will presently seem quite
natural. You must remember to put a little of the green
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">25</a></span>powder under the boiler the moment we strike the water;
but whatever you do, you must not put the green powder
in before we reach the water."</p>

<p>"Why, what will happen then?" asked Zuzu.</p>

<p>"You would better not try to find out," said the
Private Secretary, smiling. "But now, madam, first
put in a little more of the blue powder. I see we are
passing near the moon, and, if I mistake not, the face of
the moon is unusually clean to-night. I see that little
Lucy Green has been at work. You do not know how
that can be? Perhaps the Enchanted Banjo will tell
you. Put it together, my dears, and see if it will not."</p>

<p>So Lulu and Zuzu held the Banjo as before, and to
their great surprise it told them how the moon had
its face cleaned.</p>

<p class="ptitle">LITTLE LUCY GREEN</p>

<div class="poetry"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Oh, have you never heard the reason why the moon is clean?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Once on a time there was a girl whose name was Lucy Green;<br /></span>

<span class="i0">She raised her hands in horror, and exclaimed: "My, what a sight!"<br /></span>

<h2>CHAPTER VII</h2>

<p class="ptitle">THE JOURNEY THROUGH THE WATER</p>

<p>"Now we will drop down from the sky a way," said the
little dark man, "and I hope soon to show you some
other interesting things. But, madam, you must be
ready to throw the green powder into the engine the
moment I tell you to do so."</p>

<p>Even as he spoke, the boat began to descend, and now
struck the water with a soft splash. "Quick! the green
powder now!" cried the little dark man. At that
instant, the Widow Pickle tossed a pinch of the green
powder into the furnace door, and, to her great surprise,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">28</a></span>the little ship settled down gently, the steam changed
from blue to green in color, and the wheels began to turn
around with a motion which sent the boat forward
very quickly.</p>

<p>"Mamma, mamma," cried Zuzu, "we are sinking!
Look! We are going down!"</p>

<p>Lulu also was very much excited, but the Private
Secretary smilingly reassured them.</p>

<p>"Of course," he said. "Did you suppose the Gee-Whiz
Express would run upon the top of the water like
any ordinary steamboat? Any one can build a boat
like that."</p>

<p>"But we'll all be drowned," cried the Widow Pickle.</p>

<p>"Not in the least," said the Private Secretary. "We
are five hundred feet beneath the surface of the sea at
this present moment, and if we were going to be drowned
we should have begun to feel strange long ago. Evidently,
madam, you forgot the glass which covers us over.
We can see through it distinctly, but it won't let any
water in. I am sure we shall enjoy our voyage very
much. Moreover, we have with us the Enchanted Banjo,
and it will play for us whenever the Royal Heirs are so
good as to assist it."</p>

<p>The Banjo seemed to be in a jolly mood as well as the
Royal Heirs, for as soon as the Twins grasped it
together it rattled off at once into the following jingle:</p>

<p class="ptitle"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">29</a></span>SONG OF THE ENCHANTED BANJO</p>

<div class="poetry"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Once I was but a banjo of the ordinary sort<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Until a minstrel played me for the pleasure of the court,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And quite by accident he struck the sweet and simple tune<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The Fairies love the dearest when they dance beneath the moon.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Oh, it was most amazing, when to every one's surprise<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The Queen of all the Fairies came to view before their eyes!<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">They gazed upon the Fairy Queen, and she smiled back at them<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She wore a robe of woven gold, with silver on the hem,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Her wings were set with diamonds and made of golden gauze,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And she was quite the finest Fairy Queen that ever was.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She stopped before the royal court and held her place alone,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then bowed and gracefully sat down before the Royal Throne.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">The Fairy Queen then waved her wand; the minstrel stepped away,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And I, suspended in the air, at once began to play;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I played them all the Fairy tunes that ever have been made,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And everybody knew the words to everything I played.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I played before the Fairy Queen, and did my best, you see&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And therefore I enchanted her, then she enchanted me.<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>"Now let's play we are pirates!" cried Zuzu.</p>

<p>"Very well," said the Private Secretary. "The Banjo
knows that a great many people feel like playing pirate,
so perhaps it will sing of one or two." The Banjo then
played for them the following melody:</p>

<p class="ptitle"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">30</a></span>THE PIRATICAL JUNE-BUG</p>
<div class="poetry">
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">A June-bug once went out to sea&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Yo-ho, my lads, yo-ho!&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With sails aspread and helm alee&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Yo-ho, my lads, yo-ho!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He had a long, low, rakish boat;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He wore a shining overcoat;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He hummed and grumbled in his throat&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Yo-ho! the wild winds blow!<br /></span>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">This bold June-bug he said, said he:&mdash;<br /></span>

<span class="i2">Yo-ho, my lads, yo-ho!"<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He roamed about the ocean blue<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And bossed his rumbling, stumbling crew,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And sought for wicked things to do.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Yo-ho, the wild winds blow!<br /></span>

<span class="i2">Yo-ho, my lads, yo-ho!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When it sails by, with curve and dip,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And strikes the wall with bang and "bip!"<br /></span>

</div></div>
</div>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">31</a></span>The submarine boat went ahead very rapidly all this
time, dropping down until at length it struck the bottom
at a depth of several thousand feet. Fortunately, it
landed at a place where there was smooth, white sand
so that no damage was done; and it at once began to
run along the bottom of the sea.</p>

<p>"I would rather go on through the water the way we
were," said Lulu, "and not on the bottom, for I find it
much more bumpy in this way."</p>

<p>"True," said the Private Secretary, "but by journeying
upon the bottom we are not so apt to get lost as though
we tried to go directly through the water. If you will
observe, we are now following the main traveled road
to the Island of Gee-Whiz, and if all goes well we shall
hardly lose our way. I need not explain to you that to
be lost in the middle of the ocean, two or three thousand
feet below the surface, is one of the worst things that can
happen to a person. But don't think we are going
slowly, because we are making at least a hundred miles
an hour, as you may tell by looking at the scenery we
pass."</p>

<p>"And very beautiful the scenery is," said the Widow
Pickle. "Look, my children, at the trees and the hills;
and yonder is a high mountain all of coral, if I am not
mistaken."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">32</a></span>"Quite right," said the Private Secretary. "This is one
of the best places in the world for coral beads, and if
we had time we could get all we wished."</p>

<p>"Look, look, mamma!" cried Lulu, "isn't that a
whale?"</p>

<p>The Widow Pickle stopped to put on her glasses, and
the Private Secretary answered for her. "Yes," said he,
"that is a whale, and a very good one. See, it means
to swim us a race."</p>

<p>The great whale was now swimming alongside, its vast
jaws working convulsively, and its tail in such rapid
motion that long white sparks flew from its extremity<span class="err" title="original: ,">.</span></p>

<p>"Poor fellow," said the Private Secretary, "he thinks,
as you do, that we are not going very fast. See him
perspire! I can tell him now that he might as well
drop behind, for the Gee-Whiz Submarine Express is
much the fastest thing that swims the deep."</p>

<p>"But what is that out there, mamma?" cried Zuzu,
whose nose was pressed flat against the glass.</p>

<p>"That," said the Widow Pickle, "is something so
strange that I have not the slightest idea what it may be."</p>

<p>"It is a Flying Nautilus," explained the Private Secretary,
"a very beautiful creature, which has wings like
sails, but it can not sail with us; and yonder, I see, is
a Goroo; but even the Goroo will find that we go too
fast for it."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">33</a></span>The Goroo now swam alongside for some time. It
was a long, slender monster, with a body something like
that of a snake and a long, tapering head, from which
two horns arose and fell back gracefully over its shoulders.
Its eyes were very large and prominent, and it had four
or five fierce whiskers on each side of its mouth, all of
which were bright pink in color. It had twelve fins
along its back, which enabled it to swim very rapidly
indeed.</p>

<p>"The Goroo," said the Private Secretary, "is often by
mortals called a sea-serpent, and this fact causes us who
live in Gee-Whiz considerable amusement, because we
know that it is not a sea-serpent, but a Goroo. It would
eat a man if it had a chance, but it can not harm us so
long as we are in the boat.</p>

<p>"See," he continued, "that short fat-looking animal
we have just passed is a Calabite, a very rare and odd
fish, which lives entirely upon fresh oysters. It cracks
the oyster shells with its long teeth, just as you do hazelnuts,
and it eats so many that often fishermen wonder
where all their oysters have gone. If the truth were
known, it would very probably be found a Calabite had
eaten them.</p>

<p>"That large creature with a long mane and six legs
on each side," he resumed, "is a Talapud, a creature
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">34</a></span>never seen in any menagerie, so far as I know. It can
travel very fast indeed, but though it has six legs on each
side, it is very lazy, so that it rarely exerts its full speed.
We shall, no doubt, pass it easily.</p>

<p>"There, also, is a Naugalook, that bird-like thing,
which also swims with wings instead of fins. As you see,
it has a very wide and cruel beak, and many a fish
it eats each year. It is the eagle of the sea, and very
dangerous to meet unarmed, on account of its great size
and ferocity.</p>

<p>"The Waugog, as you may observe, is a sort of turtle.
There are two just coming out of their holes; stupid
things, who think of nothing but eating, and can travel
scarcely faster than a turtle upon the land. A full-grown
Waugog is as large as a church, and should we run
against one at full speed, it would jar the boat very much.
You will see, madam, that travel underneath the sea
is not without interest."</p>

<p>"I should say not," said the Widow Pickle; "quite
the opposite, indeed, and I am very glad to have my
children thus improve their education."</p>

<p>"There is one thing I should like to ask," said Zuzu,
"and I have often wondered about it."</p>

<p>"And what is that?" asked the Private Secretary.</p>

<p>"I wonder how the fishes ever go to sleep."</p>

"That," replied the Private Secretary, "is something

same curiosity. Perhaps it will tell us about that."</p>

<p>"No," the Private Secretary replied; "that is true;
but for some of these hard questions we may have to
go to the Fairies for answer, and it is some distance yet
before we get anywhere near the Fairy country."</p>

<p>"How far have we gone now, sir?" asked Zuzu.</p>

<p>"That," replied the Private Secretary, "is difficult to
explain, for you must see that we do not measure distances
as you do. However, I should think it would
take us perhaps three or four more of what you call your
hours before we are within sight of the Island of Gee-Whiz.
We must first pass the Agalone Mountains.
Indeed, it seems to me that I see that mountain range
now beginning to appear before us."</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VIII</h2>

<p class="ptitle">THE EXPLOSION OF THE SUBMARINE EXPRESS</p>

<p>"We must be sure to strike the right road through the
Agalone Mountains," said the Private Secretary, peering
out through the glass, "because a great many boats get
lost hereabouts in the long and winding path. Even
were it possible for any mortal to get thus far toward
our country, it would be very difficult to trace the way
through the Agalone Mountains, which are very high
and precipitous indeed. Moreover, to render the road
even more difficult to follow, we occasionally have these
mountains moved a few hundred leagues from side to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">38</a></span>side, so that not even the boldest mariner from your
country could tell a thing about it if he tried to follow
us."</p>

<p>"It is a wonder to me that no one has ever found this
Island of Gee-Whiz," said the Widow Pickle.</p>

<p>"Believe me, madam, it is practically impossible,"
replied the Private Secretary. "Many have sought to
discover the Island of Gee-Whiz on account of its great
riches, but no one has ever yet done so. Were it not for
the fact that these Twins, the Prince and Princess,
have corazine and malazite hair, it is scarcely likely that
you yourself would ever have seen our Island.</p>

<p>"But now," he resumed, "it is nearly time I should
go aloft and look ahead. To me it seems that these
mountains do not look so entirely familiar as they
should."</p>

<p>"Go aloft?" inquired the Widow. "How can you
go aloft? Do you mean to the surface of the sea?"</p>

<p>"Of course," said the Private Secretary. "I can see
the Island at a much greater distance from the surface
of the sea. As for going aloft, that is perfectly simple.
I set this pole in the holes which run up and down through
the top and bottom of the boat, like the place for a mast
in a sail-boat, and I then attach the clutches of this
machine here to the pole and set the engine going up and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">39</a></span>down instead of backward and forward. In that way,
as you shall presently see, the boat will begin to climb
up the pole, like a boy after birds' nests. But now,
madam, let me request you to stand near the furnace
door; and when I give the word, put in a pinch more of
the green powder to keep up the steam, for it is far
harder to climb straight up than it is to go straight ahead,
for the boat is flat on top and not pointed as it is at the
end."</p>

<p>As the Private Secretary spoke, he arranged the
clutches of the machinery as he had said, and, to their
great surprise, the boat began to climb up the pole at a
rate which left no doubt that they would very soon be
at the surface of the sea.</p>

<p>"Now," cried the Private Secretary, "put in the
powder, quick!"</p>

<p>The Widow Pickle, in a great hurry, took a pinch of
powder and cast it under the grate as she had done before.
This was where she made a great mistake, which afterward
brought upon her much criticism; for, instead of
putting in the green powder, which belonged to the sea,
in her hurry she cast in a pinch of the blue powder, which
was correct for use in the air, but not in the water. As
she did this, at once there was a blinding cloud of smoke
and a deafening explosion, which shook the sea like a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">40</a></span>volcanic eruption. The boat flew quite to pieces, as
though it had been built of cardboard. In a moment,
they were blown violently into the air beyond the surface
of the ocean.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IX</h2>

<p class="ptitle">THE ARRIVAL AT THE ISLAND</p>

<p>As the boat was blown from under them, the passengers
thought the end had come and that they must be drowned
far beneath the sea; and only the great skill and presence
of mind of the Private Secretary prevented their meeting
this fate. But as they were starting upward, carried by
the violence of the explosion, the Private Secretary
caught at the rack where the life-preservers were hanging,
and so saved their lives. As they reached the surface
he handed each a life-preserver, and soon they were all
swimming safely on the surface of a placid green sea.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">42</a></span>"Madam," said the Private Secretary sternly, "that
we are not all killed is no fault of yours. Such carelessness
deserves the utmost punishment, for now our
boat is gone."</p>

<p>"I am innocent," cried the Widow Pickle, "for I did
just what you told me to do, I am sure. I threw in the
powder; and indeed it seems to me that was what made
the explosion."</p>

<p>"Precisely," said the Private Secretary. "You put in
the wrong powder. You used the malazite instead of
the corazine&mdash;I know it as well as though I had seen
you do it myself."</p>

<p>"That is quite true," said the Widow Pickle, "but I
thought&mdash;"</p>

<p>"It is of no consequence what you thought," said the
Private Secretary. "But, for that matter, it is of no
use to argue over it now. We are here, and lucky it is
we are not drowned. Happily for us, we have been blown
some miles forward on our way, quite over the Agalone
Mountains, and shall be able to swim the remaining
distance without trouble. Yonder are the shores of the
Island now, only about a mile away."</p>

<p>It was as he said. They swam after him, and soon
there appeared a wide white beach, flanked with stately
palms, among which they saw rising the white towers
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">43</a></span>and domes of a stately city. Toward this they
swam as vigorously as they might, and in course of time
stepped upon the hard white sand of the beach and
knew that their journey was over.</p>

<p>"I am very sorry that we lost the boat," said the
Widow Pickle, "but I am extremely glad that we are
here, for I couldn't have swum another mile to save
my life. My life-preserver belt was very tight. But
what a pretty spot this is! I am sure we shall like this
place very much indeed, and I am glad we came.
Look, is not that some one coming down the beach to
meet us?"</p>

<p>"That," said the Private Secretary, "is none less than
his Majesty himself, the King of Gee-Whiz!"</p>

<h2>CHAPTER X</h2>

<p class="ptitle">THE KING OF GEE-WHIZ</p>

<p>As the King approached them, it was easy to see that
he was indeed a very important person; for all the
people fell down upon their faces before him and made a
slow deep salutation, much as though you should say
"Ah-h-h!" in this way, with a very deep breath. To
this respectful greeting the Monarch made no return
whatever. The Widow Pickle noticed this.</p>

<p>"I see that you are not fully acquainted with Monarchs,"
said the Private Secretary, "or at least I should
say with Monarchs such as ours. At times he is even
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">45</a></span>more absent-minded than he now appears. I have
known him to order half a dozen of his best friends to be
banished for some slight offense, and then to forget it
before luncheon of that same day, and ask for them
again, just as though nothing had happened."</p>

<p>"That," said the Widow Pickle, "seems to me a very
unusual sort of thing to do. I should like to see him
banish me if I did not feel like being banished at the
time!"</p>

<p>"You will pardon me," said the Private Secretary,
"but it appears to me that you must be an extraordinarily
ignorant person, for banishing persons, or even cutting
off their heads, in a fit of absent-mindedness, is a part of
the daily routine of any truly royal king, and his loyal
subjects are very fond of both. If they were not, they
could not be called truly loyal subjects; and what is
the use of being a subject unless one is a truly loyal subject,
madam?"</p>

<p>"That," said the Widow Pickle, "is a very difficult
question."</p>

<p>"I thought you would find it such," replied the Private
Secretary. "But tell me, is not our King a very royal
person? And I may add that he is as kindly a king as
ever sat on a throne. Once in a while, he does something
which indicates a slight loss of temper; but how could you
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">46</a></span>blame him, with his poor stomach, and with his love
affair with the Fairy Queen, as well, to trouble him?
It is quite enough to upset any king in the world, I am
sure."</p>

<p>"His stomach?" said the Widow Pickle. "And the
Fairy Queen? Well, the poor King, after all, may be
quite like other men. I remember that my poor dear
husband, Aurelius Pickle, used to have just such times
with his stomach. Why, at times, he could eat nothing
in the world but some of my Waffles."</p>

<p>"Your Waffles? What are those?" asked the Private
Secretary. "Are they anything new?"</p>

<p>"Well, I can't say as to that," replied the Widow
Pickle, "for my grandmother taught me how to make
them. But I may say with some pride that the Governor
of our State once ate of my Waffles and asked for two
more, and in my family that was considered very high
praise, indeed. I should like to try one on your King,
if he is troubled with his stomach."</p>

<p>"That might be quite a fine idea," said the Private
Secretary, "and if you don't object, I shall place the
matter before his Royal Highness. I have never seen
this that you call a Waffle, but if it will make the King
forget his royal trouble it may be very much better for
him and for all the rest of us."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">47</a></span>"I should be very glad, indeed, to be of any slight
assistance that I may," said the Widow Pickle modestly.</p>

<p>"But, hush!" whispered the Private Secretary. "He
is coming this way. May I suggest that just as he steps
across that white line which you see marked upon the
ground, you make him a deep reverence? I think you
call it a courtesy in your country."</p>

<p>"Very well," said the Widow Pickle, "but I shall do
no more than courtesy, and shall not make it too deep
even in that case, for I myself come of a very proud
family."</p>

<p>"Hush!" whispered the Private Secretary again. And
now the King came forward, fixing upon them the keen
glance of his royal eye. Seeing this, Lulu and Zuzu
grasped their mother's gown in their hands and shrank
back behind her, much frightened. The Private Secretary
bowed flat upon the ground and began to say
"Ah-h-h!" very fast.</p>

<p>The Widow courtesied as she was bid, looking up at the
King. Indeed, she was willing to declare the King
most extraordinary in appearance. He was about six
feet or more in height, and very dark in complexion,
almost coffee-brown in color, indeed. His hair, which
was of a bright brick-dust red, was profuse, and stuck
out around his head in a sort of fringe to the extent of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">48</a></span>two or three feet on each side. In his nose he wore a
large ring, and his teeth shone as he opened his mouth,
for in each tooth was set a fine large diamond. On his
fingers were rings of highly-shining precious stones, like
emeralds and diamonds and rubies, with others whose
names the Widow could not guess. The King wore a
garland of flowers about his neck, and carried in his hand
a war club or heavy cane made of dark wood, with a
large gold knob at the end, and set thickly with shining
stones about the handle. His feet were clad in bright-red
slippers, whose points turned up nearly to his knees.
A rich cloak of spotted fur hung across his shoulders,
although the climate was so warm that he really was in
small need of fur; so he allowed it to fall back carelessly,
confining it with a cord, which latter passed around his
chest and shoulders. Around his neck also was hung
a broad collar of cloth or leather, which was set as thick
as it could hold with all manner of brilliant, shining
stones. It was plainly to be seen that the Island of
Gee-Whiz was a land very rich indeed in precious metals
and gems, for the like of this display of gold and gems
was never before seen in any country. As the Widow
Pickle looked, she wondered where all these rich stones
and all this gold came from; and mentally she made a
resolution to discover this before very many days had
passed.</p></div>

<h2>CHAPTER XI</h2>

<p class="ptitle">THE ROYAL HEREDITARY TWINS</p>

<p>"Madam," said the King, "who are you, if I may ask,
and why do these young persons hide behind you? Let
us have no delays and no excuses. If we are to get on
in the least pleasantly, I beg you of all things to remember
that I am King. And I need hardly state that the King
of Gee-Whiz is something of a Monarch, if I may so
express it."</p>

<p>"If it please your Majesty," said the Widow Pickle,
"I am a Widow, and come from foreign parts."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">50</a></span>"That," rejoined the King, "is a claim of no special
distinction, for there are very many widows who come
from foreign parts. Pray, whatever you do, don't
bore me, for I am very easily bored, and when I am
bored I am very bored indeed, as you will readily perceive
a true King must be."</p>

<p>"That I can easily understand," said the Widow,
"but I hope that my Twins will not bore you. Come,
my children, and make your bow to the King."</p>

<p>In truth, it must be said that the Widow Pickle was
more frightened at the King than she thought she was
going to be.</p>

<p>"Yes," said the King, "let us see what your children
look like."</p>

<p>At this, very much frightened, Zuzu and Lulu came
out from behind their mother and bowed very low
before the King, and they had the presence of mind to
make the sound "Ah-h-h!" between their teeth as the
Private Secretary and others had done. The King was
pleased at this. But, at the next moment, he sprang
back with an exclamation of surprise.</p>

<p>"What!" said he, "what is that I see? Is it possible
that we have here two young persons with the Royal
Hereditary Hair in true malazite blue and royal corazine
green? Why, bless my soul and body, not since the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">51</a></span>reign of Gee-Whiz the Twelfth has a true double instance
of this kind of hair been found in all our kingdom!"</p>

<p>"Do you like their hair, your Majesty?" asked the
Widow Pickle.</p>

<p>"What a question!" exclaimed the King. "How can
I help liking it? Did not the Royal Queen Mother of our
family three thousand years ago have blue hair; and
her husband, the reigning monarch, green? My dear
madam, I look upon this as the most fortunate thing
that has occurred during my entire reign. If I am not
very much mistaken, we shall hear of strange and wonderful
things before long."</p>

<p>"I am glad you like their hair," said the Widow Pickle
proudly, "although I must say that in our country
neither was considered a fashionable color."</p>

<p>"Yours must be a very strange country," said the King
of Gee-Whiz, "and you must have associated with extraordinarily
ignorant persons, not to know that blue and
green are the finest colors in the world for hair. Really,
never in my life have I seen such a delicate shade as this.
I am so delighted that I shall at once, in accordance
with the law of the Island, have this Prince and Princess
measured for a brand-new throne each. Moreover, they
shall each have one of the Fairy Wishing Wands, which
are a part of the royal property. Whatever they wish
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">52</a></span>they shall have three times a week&mdash;but of course no
more, for that would not be lawful."</p>

<p>"Certainly not," said the Widow Pickle, although she
did not in the least understand what all this was about.</p>

<p>"As to yourself, madam," resumed the Monarch,
"although you claim to be the mother of these children,
I do not observe that your own hair shows any token
of the royal colors. In short, it is somewhat the color
of my own. I regret to state that my hair, although
once of a royal tint, was bleached by a sudden exposure
to the sun by a careless nurse when I was young." He
smiled sadly, but soon recovered. "This, however, shall
not happen to this young Prince and Princess," he said,
"for they shall have royal umbrellas and attendants to
carry them when they walk abroad.</p>

<p>"Let me think," went on the King. "I forget what
I was about to say. Was I going to banish you, my dear
madam, or have you beheaded? Jiji, get up and tell
me what I was going to say."</p>

<p>At this, the Private Secretary, who had been prostrate
with his face upon the ground all this time, arose very
quickly.</p>

<p>"Your Majesty," said he, "let me suggest that you
neither banish nor behead this good lady. Her husband
was a very remarkable man, a dealer in Chemical Substances.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">53</a></span>It was in this way, as I am assured, that he
discovered the means of making a very wonderful dish
known as the Waffle, which is considered to be a sovereign
cure for what are called the high crimes and misdemeanors
of the Royal Stomach."</p>

<hr class="tb" />
<p>"It was not my husband," began the Widow Pickle
indignantly; but the Private Secretary, bowing low,
stepped in front of her, wriggling his hands behind him
very hard.</p>

<p>"Her husband, your Majesty," said he quickly, "was
a wonderful man. I have myself seen one of these
Waffles, and they are extraordinarily fine to look upon,
although I have never eaten one. That is reserved for
royalty alone."</p>

<p>"I have eaten them often," exclaimed Zuzu.</p>

<p>"That," said the King, "is not remarkable, my dear,
because you evidently are of royal blood. But, madam,
tell me where can I get one of these Waffles to eat?"</p>

<p>"That," said the Widow Pickle, "is very easy, if you
will but get me a Waffle-iron and permit me to build a
fire here in front of the palace."</p>

<p>The King turned to the Private Secretary. "Jiji,"
said he, "get her a Waffle-iron at once. If there is no
such thing, have it made by the royal smiths. Pray,
madam, what is a Waffle-iron made of?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">54</a></span>"Of iron, your Majesty."</p>

<p>"That is too bad," said the King. "We have no such
precious metal as that. I suppose we shall have to make
it out of gold. Do you mind if we make it of gold?"</p>

<p>"I never saw one of gold, your Majesty," replied the
Widow Pickle, "but perhaps I could make out with it."
In her heart she was thinking that if she ever told her
friends she had baked Waffles on a gold Waffle-iron,
they certainly would not believe her; but we can easily
see how much mistaken her friends would have been in
that case.</p>

<p>"Very well," said the King. "Get the lady a gold
Waffle-iron and help her all you can with her work. If
she is half as good a cook as you think, she also may have
some sort of throne; although I much regret that her
hair is far from the desirable color for those of the royal
household."</p>

<p>"I ought to have a little flour," said the Widow, "and
a little milk."</p>

<p>"Milk?" said the King. "How unfortunate! The
royal cows are all lost in the woods, every one of them,
and not even the Court Detective, whom I employ for
that purpose, can find them."</p>

<p>"Don't you know how to find them?" cried Zuzu
eagerly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">55</a></span>"No, to be sure I don't. I'm too busy to learn such
things."</p>

<p>"You ask a Daddy-long-legs," said Zuzu.</p>

<p>"I beg pardon?" said the King. But just then, as
Zuzu and Lulu happened to grasp the Enchanted Banjo,
the latter began to tell the King how to find the cows&mdash;a
thing which any child could have told him.</p>

</div></div></div>

<p>"Well!" said the King, "that is a most extraordinary
thing, most extraordinary indeed, and I shall certainly
have to call the matter to the attention of my Court
Detective. But, madam, as we have no cows at present,
how would a little cocoanut milk do? We can get you
any amount of that."</p>

<p>"I have never tried it," said the Widow, "but I am
sure it will be very much better than no milk at all."</p>

<p>"Very well, then," said the King, "I'll have Jiji get
you all you want."</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XII</h2>

<p class="ptitle">THE GOLD WAFFLE-IRON</p>

<p>Meantime the Private Secretary departed, but now
in a few moments returned with a very fine new Waffle-iron,
all of gold, which he had had made as the Widow
instructed, with small hills and hollows all over its
surface.</p>

<p>"This," said the Widow Pickle, "is the most beautiful
Waffle-iron I ever used. If I do not make good Waffles
now, it surely will be my own fault."</p>

<p>So now the Private Secretary also got her some palm
flour, and two quarts of cocoanut milk; and after making
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">58</a></span>a little fire in front of the palace door, the Widow Pickle
busied herself and soon produced a nice brown Waffle,
with hills and hollows all over it, from her new gold
Waffle-iron. "Now, if I only had some syrup," said she,
"I am sure I could recommend this Waffle for any purposes
connected with eating."</p>

<p>The King had been watching her very closely in her
work. "What do you mean by syrup?" asked he
curiously.</p>

<p>"This," said the Widow, "is certainly a strange country&mdash;not
that I wish to criticize in the least, your Majesty.
But I was just thinking that a world without syrup is
very singular indeed."</p>

<p>"Well, you will understand," said the King of Gee-Whiz,
"we who live on this Island are not very different
from Fairies. At least, we are dependent upon the Fairies
for all we eat and wear and use. They are our work
people, and we have to take what they give us and be
thankful. Now, I suppose the Fairies have never considered
that syrup was necessary for us."</p>

<p>Zuzu and Lulu listened with the greatest interest, and
when the king spoke of Fairies they could not restrain
themselves.</p>

<p>"Oh, your Majesty," said Lulu, "have you ever really
seen a Fairy?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">59</a></span>"Have I?" said the King. "Thousands of them. We
get all our gold from them&mdash;when their pretty Queen,
Zulena, is good enough to grant our wishes. Fairies!
Why, they are as common as leaves upon the trees.
Are there none in your country, my Princess?"</p>

<p>"None," said Lulu, "only I have always so much
wished to see just one Fairy."</p>

<p>"If that is all you wish," said the King of Gee-Whiz,
"there will not be the least trouble about it. We got
this Enchanted Banjo from the Fairies, and I am sure
it will be obliging enough to tell you about so common a
place as Fairy-land. Won't you, Banjo?"</p>

<p>The Banjo nodded its head, and presently began to play.</p>

<p class="ptitle">FAIRY-LAND AFAR</p>

</div></div></div>

<p>"The Banjo knows more about the Fairies than any
one," said the Private Secretary. "It can tell you how
they employ themselves all these long summer days."
And thereupon the Banjo began:</p>

<p class="ptitle"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">61</a></span>WHAT THE FAIRIES DO</p>

<div class="poetry"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">

<span class="i0">The Jack-o'-lantern Fairies have to dance above the bogs<br /></span>

</div></div></div>

<p>"But now, in regard to this syrup, I wonder very much
how it tastes," interrupted the King, returning to the
matter that had been upon his mind, "tell me, how does
it taste?"</p>

<p>"Very sweet, your Majesty," said Zuzu, "and it is
very nice with Waffles. I have eaten it often."</p>

<p>"But whence do you obtain this syrup?" asked the
King.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">62</a></span>"The best kind comes out of a tree," said Zuzu, who had
often been with his uncle when he was making maple
sugar.</p>

<p>"From a tree? Oh, I suppose you get it just as I do
my palm wine when I wish, or my cocoanut milk. You
cut a hole in the tree, and catch the juice in a cup?"</p>

<p>"It is something like that, your Majesty," replied Zuzu.</p>

<p>"Then, my dear," said the King, "take this little gold
ax and run and catch me a cupful of syrup for my new
Waffle."</p>

<p>Zuzu did as he was bid and soon came back with a
cupful of very fair syrup. This the Widow at once spread
upon the hot Waffle and offered it to the King.</p>

<p>"This syrup," said the King, touching his finger to
the contents of the cup, "is most delicious. It is something
we have had all along, but did not know it."</p>

<p>"Your Majesty," said the Widow Pickle anxiously,
"I beg you will eat your Waffle while it is hot."</p>

<p>"Oh, very well," said the King wearily, "but surely
you must know that I usually am very much more bored
about eating things than any one can possibly be who
has never been a King."</p>

<p>So saying, he took his royal golden knife and fork and
cut off a morsel from the Waffle, which he placed in his
royal mouth. As he did so, to their great surprise, he
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">63</a></span>sat up straight, and a pleasant smile appeared upon his
face. His cheek stuck out where the mouthful of Waffle
lay; but the King did not act as though he intended to
swallow it, although his smile showed that he was pleased.</p>

<p>"Is it good, your Majesty?" asked the Widow Pickle
again anxiously.</p>

<p>The King nodded but did not speak. He motioned
for a piece of paper, on which he wrote the word "Excellent."</p>

<p>"Then, why do you not eat it?" asked the Widow.</p>

<p>"I fear very much there may not be anything more so
good," wrote the King.</p>

<p>At this, the Widow Pickle herself smiled happily.</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, there is, your Majesty," she cried. "I warn
you that every bite of this Waffle is as good as the first
one. Moreover, I assure you I can bake others quite
as good, as many as you like."</p>

<p>Hearing this, the King at once ate the portion of
Waffle, and, to the great joy of all, regained his voice;
for of course no King ever speaks with his mouth even
partly full.</p>

<p>"That," said the King, with a long breath, "was
the most remarkable delicacy I ever ate in all my
life. My dear madam, I am very much pleased that
I have heard of it, very much pleased, I assure you.
Indeed, I welcome you to our Island."

<img src="images/gs231.jpg" width="200" height="285" alt="The King was

</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">64</a></span>"But hurry, your Majesty," cried the Widow Pickle,
"or the Waffle will get cold!"</p>

<p>Whereupon the King, still smiling with comfort and
joy, fell to, and presently the first Waffle was quite gone.
Another followed, and yet another. "More!" cried the
King, as though he were a little boy. So the Widow
Pickle, very warm and very happy, baked Waffles until
she quite forgot to count them any more.</p>

<p>"You may have a throne made for the lady also, Jiji,"
said the King carelessly to his Private Secretary, after
a while, "for I have concluded neither to banish her nor
behead her. She shall be made the Royal Waffle Baker,
with a permanent salary."</p>

<p>The Widow Pickle was delighted, for although she had
baked many a Waffle before, she had never done so with
a gold Waffle-iron, and had never been so well rewarded
for what to her seemed a very ordinary accomplishment.</p>

<p>Later, for the entertainment of Lulu and Zuzu, the
Enchanted Banjo sang this little song, which, it said,
contained a very helpful moral lesson:</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIII</h2>

<p class="ptitle">THE FAIRY TELEPHONE</p>

<p>The next morning, after the Widow Pickle and the
Twins had finished their breakfast, they strolled for a
short time through the palace grounds, upon the edge
of which was the house which the King had given them
as their new home. Presently, they came to the place
beneath the trees where was situated the great throne
of the King of Gee-Whiz. As the climate was warm,
he always kept his throne out of doors, under the trees,
where it was cooler than in the palace. Here they now
found the King fast asleep under his umbrella; but just
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">67</a></span>as they were about to speak to him, they saw the Private
Secretary beckoning to them. They joined him and
followed him to a little distance from the throne.</p>

<p>"We must be careful," said the Private Secretary,
"not to disturb his Majesty when he is asleep. He will
probably not waken until eleven thirty-five, at which
time it will be desirable for the Royal Baker of the
Waffles to be ready to prepare his breakfast. I suggest
that a little promenade through our Island might now
be found pleasant."</p>

<p>"Can't mamma go with us?" asked Zuzu.</p>

<p>"That would be very nice," said the Private Secretary,
"except for the reasons I have given. It will
perhaps be the best and safest thing for your mamma
to remain near the palace, lest the King should suddenly
awake and be hungry."</p>

<p>So saying, the Private Secretary took Zuzu and Lulu
each by the hand and they started out for a walk in the
cool morning air.</p>

<p>Zuzu noticed that the Private Secretary carried under
his arm some little sticks or wands, which shone as
though they were made of gold and jewels.</p>

<p>"What are those little sticks that you are carrying,
sir?" asked he.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">68</a></span>"Those," said the Private Secretary, "are the Royal
Wishing Wands which have been given to you by the
King. He himself obtained them, some time ago from
the Fairy Queen. You will find them very useful;
for if there is anything in the world that you want, you
can have it by simply rubbing this Wand three times
and wishing clearly and distinctly. But you must
remember that you have only three wishes in any one
week; so I suggest that you exercise care."</p>

<p>As he spoke, the Private Secretary extended to each
of the Twins one of the Royal Wishing Wands, and with
great delight both began vigorously to rub the Wands
and to say excitedly, "I wish! I wish!"</p>

<p>"Very well," said the Private Secretary, smiling.
"What is it that you wish?"</p>

<p>"Please bring my mamma some gold and some diamonds,
a whole bushel," said Lulu; and Zuzu said, "I
wish the same, because I have often heard mamma
express a wish for those very things."</p>

<p>"Very well," said the Private Secretary, "she shall
have them just as soon as his Majesty can telephone to
the Fairy Valley. His Majesty is very liberal in such
matters as these."</p>

<p>"Telephone?" cried Zuzu. "Do you have telephones
here?"</p>

<hr class="tb" />
<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/col04.jpg" width="600" height="657" alt="Zuzu and Lulu bowed very low Page 50" title="Zuzu and Lulu bowed very low Page 50" />
<p class="caption">Zuzu and Lulu bowed very low &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Page 50</i></p>
</div>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">69</a></span>
"Certainly we do. How could the King order such
gold and diamonds as he may need, if he were not able
to telephone for them to the Fairies? You see, we get
these things only through the Fairies, who live far toward
the interior of the Island, in a place which not even I
myself have ever seen."</p>

<p>"Well, I would like to know how any one can telephone
to a Fairy," said Zuzu, who had never heard of such a
thing before.</p>

<p>"It is the simplest thing in the world," replied the
Private Secretary. "The morning is the best time for
the use of the Fairy Telephone. You will notice that
then the dew lies heavy upon all the world. All the
leaves and blades of grass are wet with it, and it shines
in the early sunlight, to my mind far more beautifully
than any diamond. Now, over this dewy world of leaves
and grass and boughs and ferns, which touch each other
quite across the Island, you will see many little fine lines,
finer than hairs, woven in and out. Sometimes you will
see long floating films and sometimes braided nets.
These are the webs of the spiders, which spin all the
time without any one asking them to work. Now, these
webs of the spiders are the lines of the Fairy Telephone,
and they run from this Island quite over into the valley
where the Fairies live."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">70</a></span>"But how can you hear?" asked Lulu. "I have had
spider webs in my hands, but I heard nothing at all."</p>

<p>"That was because you did not have a Cricket to put
to your ear at the same time," said the Private Secretary.
"If you have a good Cricket and place it at your ear,
it will say things to you. Have you not heard Crickets
chirping, chirping away, hour after hour?"</p>

<p>"Of course! of course!" cried both the Twins, "we
have heard that."</p>

<p>"Well," said the Private Secretary, "that is all there
is about it. The Crickets are simply telephoning from
the Fairies to you, and it has been your own fault that
you have not had messages from the Fairies before now.
Only I should say you must remember to have a White
Cricket for good Fairies. A Black Cricket will telephone
only to bad Fairies. His Majesty, of course, has a fine
White Cricket, which has always lived under his shadow;
and it is with this that he telephones to the Fairy Valley."</p>

<p>"I wish I had a Cricket," said Zuzu.</p>

<p>"Very well," said the Private Secretary, "you shall
have one presently; but remember that is two wishes
you have already had. And remember only a White
Cricket is the right kind."</p>

<p>Before Zuzu could think or wish again, Lulu broke in.
"I shall wish for a dewy morning and plenty of spider
webs," said she.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">71</a></span>"Very well," said the Private Secretary, "I shall make
a note of your second wish. You have now but two
wishes left for the week; although I must say that for
inexperienced wishers you have done very well."</p>

<p>"But why can't we ourselves go to the Fairy Valley,"
asked Zuzu, "if it is right here on this Island?"</p>

<p>The Private Secretary frowned. "Surely," said he,
"you are a very ignorant person if you can have such a
thought as that. The Fairy Valley is known to none of
us of the royal household. Besides, you quite forget
about the Dragon which guards the entrance to the
Valley. Listen! It seems to me I hear the Dragon's
voice at this moment."</p>

<p>They all stopped and listened, and, to be sure, they
heard at that moment a low, hoarse, roaring sound come
across the forest, sounding something like the bark of the
sea-lion in the zoölogical gardens, so that any who have
heard that will know very well how the voice of a Dragon
sounds. For, as it seems, this is what Zuzu and Lulu
heard.</p>

<p>"Yes," said the Private Secretary, "there is the
Dragon roaring now."</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIV</h2>

<p class="ptitle">JANKOW THE DRAGON</p>

<p>"I don't exactly like that sound," said Zuzu, drawing
back. "It makes my shoulders creep." Lulu also
hesitated.</p>

<p>"Don't fear," said the Private Secretary. "In my
belief the Dragon is not so bad as his voice and actions
would seem to indicate. I have lived here all my life,
and although I have known our Dragon to threaten to
do a great many things, I have never known him really
to harm anybody in his life. It seems necessary for a
Dragon to roar a great deal; but in my experience they
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">73</a></span>are not dangerous if properly approached and handled
with care."</p>

<p>Zuzu and Lulu, none the less, were very much afraid
as they went on through the woods with the Private
Secretary. The voice of the Dragon seemed to them
very loud and ferocious. They held on tight to the hands
of the Private Secretary, who led them on until at last
they came out into a wide, open space in front of a high
and jagged pile of rocks. In these rocks there was a
narrow sort of gorge or passageway, and directly in front
of this opening or door, as they presently discovered,
lay the head and shoulders of the most dreadful looking
Dragon either Zuzu or Lulu had ever heard of in all
their lives.</p>

<p>The head of the Dragon was as large as a two-horse
carriage and its mouth was as wide as a door; so that
both of the Twins could have stepped into the mouth
had they cared to do so. As they approached, they saw
that the roof of the Dragon's mouth was dark red, the
sides of its mouth and its tongue a light red in color.
It had teeth as long as one's arm. Fire at times came
out of its nostrils, and its eyes, which were as large as
bushel baskets and very bright red in color, rolled from
side to side in the most remarkable and threatening
manner.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">74</a></span>"Oh, I wish it would stop," exclaimed Lulu, beginning
to cry, as the Dragon went on growling and roaring.</p>

<p>"Arnggh! Arnggh!" it roared, and started up on its
forefeet as though to talk to these intruders. As it did
this, it moved its long body quite to the extremity of
its tail, and the Twins could hear its heavy scales
rattling at least fifty feet back in the dark passage
where the rest of the body and the tail of the Dragon
were lying. At these sights and sounds it was all the
Private Secretary could do to keep the Twins from
running away, but he held them tight by the hands.</p>

<p>"Good morning, Jankow," said he to the Dragon.
"How are you feeling to-day? Does the same tooth still
bother you?"</p>

<p>"Of course it does," said the Dragon. "How do you
suppose you would feel if you had a tooth that had been
bothering you for fifty years?"</p>

<p>"I understand," said the Private Secretary, "but thus
far the Royal Dentist has always declined to pay you a
visit, Jankow, for fear you would swallow him while he
was at work."</p>

<p>The Dragon only roared a few more times at this,
but at length he asked, "Who are these two young persons
you have with you?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">75</a></span>"These," said the Private Secretary, "are the Royal
Hereditary Twins, who have been expected on the Island
for a thousand years. You will see that one has the
Royal Hereditary malazite blue hair, while the other has
the genuine and ancient corazine green hair. Moreover,
as you will observe, they both bear the Royal Wishing
Wands, which all must obey. It is the wish of his
Majesty that they have a pleasant life upon our Island."</p>

<p>"Well, I hope they will have a better time than I
have had," said the Dragon mournfully. "What self-respecting
Dragon would ask a place like mine? I am
forced to obey the King or he will close my mouth;
and I am obliged to obey the Fairies in the valley below,
else they will pinch my tail. And I was once the Royal
Army of the first King of Gee-Whiz, a thousand years
ago!"</p>

<p>"You will see, my young friends," said the Private
Secretary, "that Dragons grow very old and are sometimes,
I fear, as short-tempered as they are long-lived;
although I mean no offense to Jankow, who really has
a tooth which should have been extracted, had he not
been so proud of retaining a full set of teeth. And what
he says about being the Royal Army is quite true."</p>

<p>"Indeed, it is," said the Dragon proudly. "I was the
sole defense of this Island against the Wicked Fairies
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">76</a></span>a thousand years ago, but now I am obliged to defend
the Fairies as well. Were it not for me, they would get
out of the Secret Valley and make trouble perhaps even
now. I keep everybody in on one side and everybody
out on the other. So I may say that I am still the support
of this kingdom, although I am older than I once
was."</p>

<p>"Oh, I see," cried Lulu. "That is why they telephone
to the Fairies."</p>

<p>"Yes," growled the Dragon, "that is how they get
around me. The new King has in some mysterious way
discovered the use of the telephone. It makes me more
than ever discontented with my place. And I can tell
them that for a faithful, hard-working Dragon they'd
have a hard enough time getting my superior, of that I
am very sure. And all this indignity to me, who lost
a limb in the service of my country!"</p>

<p>"What does he mean by that?" asked Lulu of the
Private Secretary.</p>

<p>"It is true," said the latter. "He should have eight
legs, including the two in front, which are by far the
largest and most important of the eight. But if you will
observe closely, you will see that Jankow's left foreleg
is of wood and merely painted over."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">77</a></span>"Yes, and needs a fresh coat of paint as well," growled
the Dragon, none the less thrusting out his wooden leg
that all might see it. "I am a very much neglected
Royal Army, as you can readily see for yourself. Moreover,
this loss of one of my most important legs confines
me to this spot. I have been here for over a thousand
years. A great many persons think they would like
nothing so much as to be a Dragon, but I can tell them
that they might not find it so pleasant after all, for being
an honest and hard-working Dragon is no light task."</p>

<p>"Don't you go to sleep each night?" asked Zuzu.</p>

<p>"I never go to sleep at all. For over a thousand
years I have not had a nap. There is nothing in the
world can put me to sleep."</p>

<p>"Except <em>one</em> thing," said the Private Secretary,
smiling.</p>

<p>The Dragon scowled at him. "What is the use of
mocking me?" it said. "Of course, I know that the
Enchanted Banjo might put me to sleep, but that plays
only for the King; but not until that takes place does
any person get by Jankow, the Royal Dragon."</p>

<p>"We quite trust you, Jankow," said the Private Secretary,
"and I agree with you that you are a most
excellent and satisfactory Dragon. But now, my young
friends, if you please, we would better start back to the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">78</a></span>royal palace, for his Majesty will be waking before long.
I only hope that the royal Waffles will continue to be
satisfactory!"</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XV</h2>

<p class="ptitle">THE GOLDEN LADDER TO FAIRY-LAND</p>

<p>The Widow Pickle proved that she had not lost her
skill in the art of baking Waffles, and those which she
furnished for the royal breakfast-table could not have
been surpassed in any land. After eating several platefuls,
the King had again fallen asleep, remarking that
he had not slept so well for years. The Widow Pickle
herself was taking a nap in a hammock under the trees
when the Twins finally returned; and, seeing that every
one was fast asleep and they themselves left alone, they
presently wandered out a little way into the edge of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">80</a></span>the wood, where they sat down side by side upon a log,
their royal crowns upon their brows and the Royal
Wishing Wands in their hands.</p>

<p>They sat thus, staring out over the distant sea.</p>

<p>"This is a very strange and wonderful country," said
Zuzu, "and I am sure I should never have expected to
be here, above all places. I sometimes have to rub my
eyes to be sure I am awake. Now, the very idea that we
should be so close to actual Fairies, to have them all
about, or at least within a short walk&mdash;that is very strange
and hard for me to believe."</p>

<p>"But we don't see them anywhere," said Lulu ruefully.
"Now, Fairies may be very close to one, indeed be almost
any place about, and still one may not see them. We
seem to be very little better off than when we were at
home over there;" and she waved her hand toward the
distant blue sea, from the other side of which they had
come to this strange Island of Gee-Whiz.</p>

<p>Zuzu sat thoughtful for a moment. "Yet," said he,
"here we are, with thrones almost as good as that of the
King, and with Royal Wishing Wands, which will bring
us anything we want if we only ask for it; and you know
we are allowed to telephone to the Fairies."</p>

<p>"That is true," cried Lulu, "I had forgotten that.
But we must have a web and a Cricket. A White
Cricket may be very hard to find."</p>

<p class="caption">Zuzu put the cricket to his ear &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Page 81</i></p>
</div>

<hr class="tb" />
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">81</a></span>"Perhaps if we got a plain black one it would do just
as well," said Zuzu. "Look, there goes one now!" And
indeed, as they glanced down they saw a large Black
Cricket hopping along through the grass.</p>

<p>"I will get it," cried Zuzu, and sprang after it with
his hat in his hand, soon returning with the Cricket
held in his fingers.</p>

<p>"Now we must have some spider webs," said Lulu,
forgetting that they were not complying with the conditions
the Private Secretary had told them. They forgot
to look for a White Cricket, but eagerly ran about in the
grass searching for a spider web. At length, under a
wide burdock leaf, they found one. "Here is the Fairy
Telephone," cried Lulu. "Quick! Quick! Listen! Let
us hear what the Cricket and the spider say for us!"</p>

<p>So Zuzu put the Cricket to his ear. "Creek! Creek!"
said the Cricket. Then, as he listened very closely,
Zuzu heard something very thin and very far away begin
to sing to him.</p>

<p>"Aha!" cried Zuzu, "this is not such a bad Cricket
after all. I shall call the Fairy, and we'll see what
it is, good or bad." So he called out in a loud voice
over the Telephone, "Come, Fairy, come!"</p>

<p>To their great surprise, as he spoke there stood at
their feet a little Black Fairy, with pointed hat, who
smiled and bowed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">82</a></span>"Pray, who are you?" asked Zuzu.</p>

<p>"I am Gobo, a Fairy," he explained. "What was it
that you wished, good sir?"</p>

<p>"We wish to see a Fairy," replied Lulu eagerly. "Are
you a Fairy?"</p>

<p>"I am one sort of Fairy," replied the little one. "Unhappily,
there are other kinds, as I must admit."</p>

<p>"But we wish to see the real ones, with white wings.
We want to go to the Valley of the Fairies, where we
may see the Queen herself and learn how the good Fairies
live," said Lulu.</p>

<p>"I can be of no use in that case," said the little one,
turning away gruffly.</p>

<p>"But surely you can help us to get into the Fairy
Valley!" cried Lulu.</p>

<p>"I might get into trouble if I did too much talking,"
replied the little one. "But why do you ask me so
foolish and childish a question, when you have all the
means in your power without my aid?"</p>

<p>"What do you mean?" cried Zuzu eagerly. "It is
true, we have three wishes every week, though foolishly,
like most Twins, we often wish the same thing, and so
shorten our allowance. In this way we have nearly
used up all our wishes for this week, and I am sure we
can not wait another whole week before trying to get to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">83</a></span>the Fairy Valley, where the Queen lives and whence
all the gold and jewels come."</p>

<p>"Aha!" laughed the little black one. "Suppose I
should tell you. Could you keep the secret to yourselves?"</p>

<p>"To be sure we could," cried both the Twins. "We
would not tell a soul on the Island."</p>

<p>"Then why not go?" said the little one. "Have you
not the Enchanted Banjo?"</p>

<p>"We could get it," said Zuzu, "and it plays for us."</p>

<p>"That I know," said the Wicked Fairy, "and with
the Enchanted Banjo can you not do all manner of
things? For instance, although I do not say it or admit
it, would not the Enchanted Banjo put the Dragon to
sleep?"</p>

<p>"Precisely what the Private Secretary said, and indeed
what the Dragon himself wished!" said Zuzu.</p>

<p>"And if the Dragon were asleep," said the Wicked
Fairy, "would it not be easy to unscrew his wooden leg,
and leave him so that he could not get away, no matter
how hard he tried? And if he were helpless, what could
hinder you from slipping past him and going down the
Golden Ladder into the Valley of the Fairies, which he
guards so faithfully?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">84</a></span>"The Golden Ladder?" cried Lulu. "What is that?"</p>

<p>"You must be a very ignorant person not to know,"
said the Fairy. "That is the stairway of the Fairies,
very long but not hard to travel, if you know the way.
It leads to the Fairy Valley, that is sure; and it is also
sure that no person except a Fairy has ever been down
that Golden Ladder, no, not in the thousands of years
that I have lived on this Island; and that is the truth
and you may depend on it, even if I am called a Wicked
Fairy and answer the Black Cricket instead of the White."</p>

<p>"But could we ever get back again?" asked Zuzu
fearfully.</p>

<p>"That is for you to determine," said the Wicked Fairy,
scowling.</p>

<p>In his excitement over these matters Zuzu had let go
of the Cricket, which, finding itself at liberty, now
hopped away and crawled under a log. As he stooped
over to pick up the Cricket, Zuzu noticed that the Wicked
Fairy was gone; so they could ask no more about this
matter of the Golden Ladder into the Valley of the Fairies.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVI</h2>

<p class="ptitle">THE KING AND THE WICKED FAIRY</p>

<p>On the morning following this event, the King of Gee-Whiz
woke in great good humor. "I declare, I never
felt better in my life," said he to his Private Secretary,
"and I believe it is all due to those excellent Waffles
which the lady has made for me. I must have some
more, and that at once. Pray, tell her to get ready my
breakfast, and to have not less than two dozen Waffles
at the least."</p>

<p>"Very good, your Majesty," said the Private Secretary,
smiling, and very glad that he had been able to find
something so much to the King's liking.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">86</a></span>"And where are the Royal Hereditary Twins, this
morning?" asked the King. "They are, I suppose,
perfectly happy?"</p>

<p>"Perfectly," replied the Private Secretary, "as indeed
they ought to be. I presume they are wandering somewhere
about in the forest, as is their custom. I need
hardly say that they have already nearly exhausted
their three wishes."</p>

<p>"Well," said the King, "we need not fear they will
wish anything dangerous. But do you know, my dear
Jiji, I have been feeling rather nervous myself this
morning."</p>

<p>"Why, your Majesty, what can be the trouble?"</p>

<p>"I can not call it exactly any trouble, for it is a mere
uneasiness. The truth is, I felt as though there were
some one behind my bed all the morning. Now, that
can not possibly be the case."</p>

<p>"No, your Majesty," said the Private Secretary,
"because I always sleep across the door-mat myself,
and it would be impossible for any one to reach your
Majesty's bedside without my knowing it. Permit me
to suggest that perhaps the royal Waffles&mdash;"</p>

<p>"No, no," exclaimed the King decidedly. "It is
not in the least the Waffles. It is nothing&mdash;only a dream,
perhaps. Yet I wonder if any of the Fairies can have
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">87</a></span>got out of the valley. If I thought so, I would have
Jankow court-martialed, and perhaps beheaded. He is
getting a trifle too old for a good Dragon, anyhow."</p>

<p>"Impossible," said the kind-hearted Private Secretary.
"I saw Jankow but yesterday, and he is as wide-awake
as ever."</p>

<p>"As for myself," replied the King, "I have not slept
so well for a hundred years, although I can not tell
whether it is the Waffles or the syrup."</p>

<p>"It was a fortunate thing, your Majesty, that you
found the syrup so easily," said the Private Secretary.</p>

<p>"Quite right," replied the King. "And since it is
not yet quite breakfast time, I think I shall just wander
out into the woods and carry my ax, in case I should
find a syrup tree. Although I am King, I believe in
every man doing a little work for himself, you know."</p>

<p>So saying, the King stepped out into the edge of the
great forest which surrounded the palace, humming a
tune to himself, for he felt very contented that morning.
He was not aware that at his side, hopping along as he
walked, was the little Black Wicked Fairy which had
been summoned by Zuzu's thoughtless message of the
evening before. This Wicked Fairy, when Zuzu had
stooped over to find his Cricket, had merely slipped back
under a leaf and hidden himself, where he had stood
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">88</a></span>laughing to himself at the confusion of Lulu and Zuzu.
It seems to be a peculiarity of Wicked Fairies never to
oblige any one if they can help doing so; and that this
is true may be seen from the acts of this Wicked Fairy
in regard to the Telephone.</p>

<p>No sooner had Zuzu and Lulu left the forest on the
night before than the Wicked Fairy followed them to
their own house near the palace. He spied upon all the
surroundings, and soon discovered the sleeping apartments
of the King. He hopped over the form of the
Private Secretary after the latter had gone to sleep, and
so hid himself behind the royal bedstead, as the King
had dimly felt was the case.</p>

<p>Now, it was not in the power of the Wicked Fairy
actually to harm the King or any other person, but only
to encourage persons to do things which would get them
into trouble. Thus it was he who had suggested to the
King to take his ax and go out into the woods to find a
syrup tree. This was really the worst thing in the
world the King could have done, as was very soon to
be shown; for it was far from the Fairy's intentions that
the King should cut into a real syrup tree.</p>

<p>As the King went on, with his gold ax over his shoulder,
he was thinking of a great many things which he ought
to do, or wanted to do, or did not want to do. By this
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">89</a></span>time, the sun was shining brightly, so that the shadow
of the King appeared distinctly upon the ground. Now,
you must know that the shadow of a king is very much
better and bigger than the shadow of a common person.
A king will not cause a shadow in the dark, or at least
very few kings will; but in a brilliant place, even if
there be intervening objects, the shadow of a king is
very clear and distinct. The King of Gee-Whiz was
very proud of his shadow, for, being a trifle vain, he
thought himself a very handsome man, and that, indeed,
he once had been; which is the same thing, for a King.</p>

<p>Now, as he looked down at the ground, he saw his
shadow moving along at his side, keeping step with him
regularly and looking, as it seemed to him, very large
and handsome. He stood for a time at an open space
in the forest, with his ax resting on a stump, looking with
pride on his shadow, which he thought was quite the
most superior shadow he had ever seen. When he made
a motion, the shadow made the same. He raised his
hand to his head in royal salute, and the shadow did
quite the same. "Even a shadow has reverence for
the King," said he, and he felt very glad that he had been
born a King, as the position carried with it many advantages
of a very obvious nature.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">90</a></span>"I don't see what I could do without my shadow,"
said the King of Gee-Whiz. "It and my faithful Private
Secretary are my best friends and companions, and
without them I should be very lonesome; for not even a
King, I presume, could eat Waffles all the time. I am
sure I should miss my shadow above all things."</p>

<p>As the King of Gee-Whiz said this, he looked about
him uneasily, with something of the same feeling he had
experienced when he thought some one was behind his
bed. There was good reason for this, for in both cases
the Wicked Fairy was directly at his elbow, although
the King could not see him.</p>

<p>"Well, well," said the King, "I will just draw me a
jug of syrup, and I am sure the exercise will do me good.
Even a King must have physical culture, or fall quite
behind the times. Let me see. Ah, here is a tree which
looks precisely like a syrup tree."</p>

<p>So saying, he laid about him with his ax and cleared
a little space so that he could get at the trunk of the tree.
It was then that the Wicked Fairy whispered in his ear,
although the King did not know it: "Cut into that tree,
the one with the big green leaves!"</p>

<p>The King of Gee-Whiz, not knowing that a Fairy was
there, thought it was his own voice he had heard. "Eh?"
said he. "Ah, to be sure, this certainly is the tree.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">91</a></span>So now for a little exercise, and some syrup for my breakfast."
So saying he swung his gold ax and cut deep
into the trunk of the tree the Fairy had shown him.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVII</h2>

<p class="ptitle">THE KING AND THE RUBBER TREE</p>

<p>Now, in the forests of the Island of Gee-Whiz are very
many sorts of trees&mdash;palm trees, tall and stately, with
parasols at their tops; juju trees, with rough, sticky sides
and long, slender leaves; and strawberry trees, not in
the least resembling our little creeping vines. There
are also orange trees, with ripe yellow oranges, and trees
with fruit resembling chocolate éclaires, all ready for eating,
and other trees which bear fruit much like a charlotte
russe. Besides these, there are many trees such
as we all know&mdash;hickory, oak, and apple trees, and maple
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">93</a></span>trees, from which maple sugar comes. It was, of course,
from the sugar-maple tree that Zuzu had drawn the syrup
for the Waffles; and that, of course, was the kind of
tree into which the King should have cut with his little
gold ax. But, being guided by this Wicked Fairy whom
he could not see, the King was not aware of this. The
truth is that, as he swung his ax and cut into the tree
before him, it was not a maple tree at all, but a rubber
tree. As he struck the trunk, to his great surprise,
there gushed out not a pale, sticky syrup, but a fresh-looking
liquid, which resembled milk.</p>

<p>"Bless my soul and body!" said the King. "That
does not look right."</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, it does," whispered the Wicked Fairy in
his ear.</p>

<p>"Eh? What?" said the King, still not knowing it was
a Fairy. "Yes, I suppose this must be right. In any
case, I will taste it and see." So he held out his cup and
caught it full of the rubber juice and drank a deep draft
of it. To his great surprise, he began to feel very strange.</p>

<p>"Bless my soul and body!" exclaimed the King to
himself. "This is most extraordinary. I must say that
I feel strange, quite strange, I do indeed. Why, this
is not in the least like the syrup I tasted yesterday
morning. I wonder if I could have made a mistake."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">94</a></span>"It is no mistake," whispered the Fairy, "that is the
right tree."</p>

<p>"Eh? What?" said the King. "Oh, yes, so it is, so
it is. At first, it seemed to me that the syrup was not
the same."</p>

<p>"Take some more," whispered the Wicked Fairy; and
the King, still not knowing there was a Wicked Fairy
there, did so, this time taking a deep draft.</p>

<p>"Bless my soul and body!" cried he this time. "I
begin to feel very strange, very strange indeed. I feel
really light-headed."</p>

<p>He looked down at his shadow, but the shadow still
was there, keeping time with every motion, so that he
felt much comforted.</p>

<p>"My shadow is just the same," said the King, "so
everything must be all right. But, dear me, what is
the matter with my leg?"</p>

<p>The King had, in stepping back from the tree, caught
his foot between two roots, and now, instead of releasing
his foot when he pulled at it, he saw, to his great surprise,
that he was stretching his leg out to twice its natural
length.</p>

<p>"Dear me!" he said, as he moved back and sat down
on a log, looking in curiosity at his leg, which was now
about ten or perhaps eleven feet long and much thinner
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">95</a></span>than before. "Bless my soul and body! If I were not
the King and quite wide-awake, I should say that something
was happening to me, I should indeed. This
impresses me as being most extraordinary. Where is
my shadow?" He looked around and there was the
shadow just the same, with its leg as long as his, which
made the King again feel very much better.</p>

<p>"It does not hurt," said the King, shaking his head;
and the shadow also shook its head to show that it was
not in any pain.</p>

<p>"Take another drink," whispered the Wicked Fairy
to the King.</p>

<p>"Well, if it does not hurt any," said the King to himself,
"and since the thing is so curious, I will take another
sip of the syrup, I believe." He did so, and this time his
hand, which had rested on the tree, remained there when
he went back to the log to sit down, his arm stretching
out as long as his leg. This was very much to the King's
surprise. He gave a sharp jerk, and both arm and leg
shortened as they flew back quite as though they had
been fast to a strong rubber cord. At this the King
perspired a trifle and moved away toward the other end
of the log, looking down at his hand and foot as he did
so. To his great surprise, as he sat down on the log,
he felt himself gently bounce up again in the air, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">96</a></span>this was repeated each time as he struck the log, so that
it was some moments before he could really settle down.
Even then he felt very touchy and insecure, so that he
scarcely dared draw a long breath. Indeed, when at
length he did draw a long breath, he found, to his great
surprise, that his chest swelled out like a small balloon,
so that he was more than three times as large around
as he was before. He was much alarmed at this, but
smiled again when he saw that his shadow was quite as
large as himself.</p>

<p>"Bless my soul and body!" said the King to himself,
"I wonder if they will know me now. This is what I
call great good fortune! The truth is that I have always
felt larger than I really looked, so I am very glad
I cut into this tree and got a taste of something to make
me grow to my real size. I have long looked for something
of precisely this sort."</p>

<p>"Why not get up and dance?" asked the Wicked Fairy
in his ear.</p>

<p>"Eh? What?" said the King. "Dance? Oh, yes, I
certainly am happy enough to dance at this new discovery.
Indeed, my spirits have at no time felt more elastic than
at the present moment. So, since there is nothing to
prevent it, I think I will do a royal step or two to pass
away the time before breakfast."</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVIII</h2>

<p class="ptitle">THE KING LOSES HIS SHADOW</p>

<p>The King of Gee-Whiz stepped out into an open space
in the forest, and, to his very great surprise, observed
that he could not feel his feet touch the ground. This
was really because he was so full of rubber, although he
himself had no idea of any such thing at all. He was
conscious only of feeling that he had all along been a
greater King than he had had credit for being. So he
hummed a tune to himself as he began to dance.</p>

<p>There was probably never a dance just such as this
which the King of Gee-Whiz now began. Had he himself
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">98</a></span>seen it from a distance, he would have been sure
that it was not the performance of a dignified and respectable
King. He sprang from one foot to the other,
and each time he touched the ground he rebounded into
the air a dozen feet, or possibly even more. He alighted
upon both feet, muttering as he did so an exclamation
of delight, for, strange as that may seem, he was enjoying
himself very much. Each time that both his feet struck
the ground he went into the air just twice as far as when
only one foot was so employed. He slapped his arms
upon his chest, and as he did this, to his great surprise,
a squeak came out of his mouth exactly similar to that
which comes from the hole in a rubber ball when you
squeeze it. This startled him at first, but he was too
busy to think about it long.</p>

<p>He sprang from side to side; and whereas in a common
dancing step a King goes scarcely more than two or
three feet at a stride, the King now would step at least
a dozen feet, or, for that matter, perhaps twenty. There
seemed to be no limit to the length of the steps he could
take; and whenever he took a step he bounded high into
the air, at times having difficulty in keeping himself
from turning quite over in the air. Indeed, the temptation
to turn hand-springs and somersaults as he had done
when a boy became so strong upon him that only his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">99</a></span>great kingly dignity served to prevent his doing that
very thing.</p>

<p>"Aha!" cried the King, "this certainly is fine." At
least these are the words which he wished to say, although
all that he could hear were several sharp whistles as the
breath came out of his mouth.</p>

<p>The King sprang up and down very hard, anxious to
see how high he could go into the air. To his great surprise,
he found that by making several leaps up and down
he could easily bound upward as high as the top of the
tallest palms. This pleased him very much, as in this
position he secured a wider view of his own possessions
than he had ever had in his life before.</p>

<p>"I shall come back here once in a while," said the King
to himself, "and have another drink at that rubber tree,
if this dose wears off after a while. This really is wonderful.
It enlarges my outlook upon life many-fold,
and although I have previously to this felt very much
of a King, I now begin to understand how much I have
underrated my own abilities in every line of activity.
But, by the way," he added to himself, "this exercise
is affecting the royal appetite. I think I'll step over
and have my breakfast."</p>

<p>So in one or two long strides he walked over to the
palace and called aloud to his Private Secretary and to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">100</a></span>the Widow Pickle. To his great surprise, when he called
aloud, the King could not speak a word, but could only
whistle. He put up his hand to his face to feel what
was the matter with his voice, but of course he could
not feel anything about his voice. He did, however,
observe, very much to his annoyance, that his royal
aquiline nose had quite disappeared, that his mouth
now extended quite across his face, that his ears were
small and almost gone into his head, and that for a forehead
nothing remained but a wide, round expanse,
which he could easily dent with his thumb. In short,
he resembled, to the touch at least, although, of course,
he could not see himself, nothing in the world so much
as a large, soft, rubber ball, hollow and inflated, and with
legs and arms attached.</p>

<p>When the King realized this and found also that his
voice was gone, a sudden fear fell upon him. "My soul
and body!" thought he to himself, "can this be true?
If so, I am in the worst sort of a situation, for no one
will recognize me!" So saying, he sank down upon the
ground near the palace door, and after a number of
bounces up and down at last settled into an attitude of
Deep Thought.</p>

<p>After the King had thought for quite a time, he happened
to look upon the ground before him. To his great
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">101</a></span>surprise, there was no shadow there. He had not known
that all along it had been the intention of the Wicked
Fairy to steal his shadow. Such, however, had been
the case. While the King was at the top of one of his
highest bounds, the Wicked Fairy, who had remained
upon the ground below, took the opportunity to remove
his shadow from beneath him; so that after that the King
cast no shadow at all. Just how this was done it is
hard to say. Perhaps the Chemist, Aurelius Pickle,
who knew many strange things, could have told how
this occurred, but he, being dead, could not be asked.
It may be that as the King was stretched out to thrice
his natural height, he was thrice his natural thinness,
and that the shadow also became three times as thin,
and so was easy to take away. In any case, certainly
the Wicked Fairy had removed the King's shadow, and,
of course, with it the White Cricket which had always
lived in that shadow. When the King looked down and
saw what had happened, he fell back in a deep swoon
of terror.</p>

<p>For a moment all was still; then there came from
somewhere off in the distance, the doleful tones of the
Enchanted Banjo.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIX</h2>

<p class="ptitle">TROUBLES AT THE ROYAL PALACE</p>

<p>About the time these events were happening the Widow
Pickle was preparing to make ready the King's breakfast.
As she came from her house and approached the palace,
her eyes rested upon the prostrate body of the King.</p>

<p>"This," said the Widow Pickle, "is the strangest
looking object I ever saw in all my life. I wonder
what it is."</p>

<p>At this time there came around the corner of the
palace the Private Secretary of the King. "Good
morning, Widow Pickle," said the Private Secretary.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">104</a></span>"Have you seen his Royal Highness anywhere this
morning? It is nearly his breakfast hour, and no one
knows where he is."</p>

<p>"I don't know either," said the Widow Pickle; "but
I do know that it is scandalously late for any decent King
to be lying abed. But tell me, what is this thing lying
here, do you suppose?"</p>

<p>As she spoke, she gave the King a poke with her foot,
which immediately made him resolve to have her beheaded.
The King recognized his Private Secretary and made
frantic efforts to speak to him, all the time gesticulating
in the wildest manner; but all he could do was to squeak
as before; and the worst of it was that, as he became
excited, he began again to bound up and down in the
most violent manner.</p>

<p>"Mercy on us!" said the Widow Pickle. "I didn't
know it was alive! What do you suppose it is?"</p>

<p>The Private Secretary took a second look and turned
deathly pale.</p>

<p>"Madam," said he in a whisper, "it is none less than
his Royal Highness, though what has come to him I
can not say. But that it is the King I can swear by these
two fingers on his hands and by the pink strawberry
mark upon his shoulder."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">105</a></span>"Your Majesty!" cried the faithful Private Secretary,
"calm yourself, I beseech you. Pray be seated."</p>

<p>The King continued to bound up and down.</p>

<p>"Your Majesty," said the Private Secretary, "how
came you in this unfortunate condition? I am very
much distressed, indeed, your Majesty. But will you not
be seated?"</p>

<p>The King violently shook his head and resumed his
agitation, until at length the Private Secretary grasped
him by one arm and so at last brought him to a stop
and placed him upon the Royal Throne.</p>

<p>"Why, your Majesty," said the Private Secretary,
"you are light as a feather! Pray, tell me, how has this
happened?"</p>

<p>The King could only squeak as before, but now he
made a violent motion toward his feet. The Private
Secretary understood him, as any good Private Secretary
should be able to understand even the inmost thoughts
of his King.</p>

<p>"Quite right, your Majesty," said he. "I shall send
at once for the Court Physician."</p>

<p>So presently the Court Physician came up on a run,
and, seeing what was the trouble, took his keen lancet
and bled the King in his royal left foot. At once
there was a sharp, hissing sound, and the dimensions
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">106</a></span>of the King began to subside. In a few moments he had
shrunk to such a size that he could be recognized by all.
But now he was in such a rage that he could not make
himself understood, but merely spluttered. Then he was
for beheading the Widow Pickle at once for kicking him
while he was helpless. Then he changed his mind, and
ordered everybody banished from the Island except
himself. This notion also passed, and he at length
became more calm.</p>

<p>"Your Majesty, it was all those Waffles," cried the
Court Physician, who was jealous of the Widow Pickle.</p>

<p>"Not in the least," declared the Widow Pickle. "That
was never said of my Waffles before, as I am an honest
woman."</p>

<p>The King was a just Monarch, after all, and presently
admitted it was not the Waffles, but what he had taken
to be the syrup, which he was now ready to agree was
perhaps a foreign substance of a dangerous nature. He
explained the appearance of the tree from which he had
taken the liquid, and the Court Physician in post-haste
set off to the forest. He returned at length quite out of
breath, and assured the King that he had examined the
tree and found that it was not a syrup tree or <i>Arbor
saccharinus</i>, but a rubber tree, <i>Arbor elasticus horribiliensis</i>,
whose juice was capable of the most singular
consequences when taken into the human system.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">107</a></span>"That explains all," said the King, who was now
leaning weakly back upon the throne, very weary and
pale; "all but one thing." As he spoke, he slowly and
tremblingly turned his head and looked upon the ground
to see if he could discover his shadow.</p>

<p>"Look! Look!" cried the King, pointing before him.</p>

<p>The Court Physician and the Private Secretary both
looked but could see nothing.</p>

<p>"There is nothing there, your Majesty," said the Court
Physician.</p>

<p>"Nothing there!" exclaimed the King. "Of course
there is nothing there&mdash;why, my soul and body! can't
you see my royal shadow is gone?"</p>

<p>They looked again, and, to their great surprise, saw it
was quite as the King had said. They looked all around,
back of the throne, in front of it, and under it, and behind
the door, but, seek as they might, could find no trace of
the royal shadow.</p>

<p>"This," said the King, "is very terrible. I have been
attached to that shadow for so long that I am sure I
do not know what I shall do without it. Why, I feel
so lonesome! Tell me what I shall do, tell me at once!
Why do I employ an expensive Court Physician and a
Private Secretary, if they are not able to tell me what
to do in a case like this?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">108</a></span>"If your Majesty will pardon me," said the Court
Physician, "I would suggest that this is rather the work
of the Court Detective."</p>

<p>"Nonsense!" said the King. "Jiji, do you go at once
to the Court Tailor and Royal Robe Maker and have
him take my measure for a new shadow. And now bring
me my Waffles immediately, my good woman, for I am
very much exhausted by all these trying circumstances."</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XX</h2>

<p class="ptitle">THE DISAPPEARANCE OF THE ROYAL TWINS</p>

<p>In the meantime, it hardly need be said, the Wicked
Fairy had fled far away with the King's shadow, so that
there was not the slightest use in looking for it about
the palace. In the meantime, also, the advice of the
Wicked Fairy to the Twins had been productive of
further trouble. Hardly had the two well arisen from
their beds before they began to whisper together about
certain plans.</p>

<p>First, they got possession of the Enchanted Banjo;
for it hardly need be said that they now proposed a
journey to the Valley of the Fairies, and without the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">110</a></span>Banjo they could not put the Dragon Jankow to sleep.
The Private Secretary, excited over the condition of the
King, did not miss the Banjo, so Lulu and Zuzu had no
difficulty in taking it away.</p>

<p>"Pray, where are you going with me?" asked the
Enchanted Banjo of the Twins.</p>

<p>"Where should we be going," replied Zuzu, "if not to
the Valley of the Fairies? Will you not go with us?"</p>

<p>"With all my heart," said the Enchanted Banjo, "for
it was in that Valley that I was born. You may depend
upon me; but we shall need to be very careful indeed."</p>

<p>By this time, as the Twins walked on their way through
the forest, they began to hear the voice of the Dragon&mdash;"Arrnghgh!
Arrnghgh!"&mdash;but they went on as bravely
as they could, and presently were directly before the
Dragon, which again reared and rattled its long body
covered with heavy scales. This was a fearful sight,
but Zuzu and Lulu tightly grasped the Enchanted
Banjo, and it began to play:</p>

<p class="ptitle">THE LULLABY OF ENCHANTMENT</p>

<div class="poetry"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Ho, Little Wind, come out of the west<br /></span>

<span class="i4">Lullaby, lullaby, low.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Ho, Little Wind, you may creep, if you will<br /></span>

</div></div></div>

<p>At the first verse of this song, the Dragon began to
beat time with his good foreleg; then it began to nod
a little, and then it yawned very wide and deep, until
one could see very far down into its hollow throat. "Dear
me!" said the Dragon, "I feel very drowsy this morning.
I think I must have a bit of spring fever."</p>

<p>"Play again," whispered Zuzu to the Enchanted
Banjo. So the Banjo played again:</p>

<span class="i4">Lullaby, lullaby, low.<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>By this time, the Dragon was openly nodding at its
post of duty. Its head would fall down, and then it
would waken and jerk its head upright again and frown
at them as though they had accused it of being asleep
when nothing of the sort was true. At last, it laid its
head down upon a rock for a pillow and went fast asleep,
snoring so loudly that it might have been heard at least
the distance of a mile.</p>

<p>"Quick! Quick!" cried Zuzu, when they saw the great
Dragon was indeed asleep. "Give me the screw-driver
from the lunch basket, quick!"</p>

<p>Lulu felt in the basket which she carried and found the
screw-driver, and at once Zuzu sprang to the side of the
Dragon and with a few strokes unscrewed the wooden
leg of the Dragon close up to the shoulder.</p>

<p>"Now," cried Zuzu, "hurry, and soon we shall be at
the Valley."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">113</a></span>So now they stepped close to the side of the sleeping
Dragon and edged past through the long, narrow passageway
where the great tail lay curled up. They jumped
close against the wall whenever the Dragon stirred in
his sleep, and for the last few paces of the passage they
almost ran. But the Dragon did not waken and they
got through in safety. Then, to their great surprise,
they found themselves directly at the top of a long,
narrow, golden ladder, which fell straight down, down
from the edge of a break in the rocky floor. It extended
down farther than they could see, until finally its two
sides seemed to unite in a shining thread of gold far below.</p>

<p>"This," said Zuzu, "must be the Fairy Ladder. Quick,
before the Dragon wakens!"</p></div>

<h2>CHAPTER XXI</h2>

<p class="ptitle">THE JOURNEY TO FAIRY-LAND</p>

<p>Nobody can tell how far the Twins went down the
Golden Ladder before they dared to stop. It may have
been an hour or two hours before they began to get so
tired that it seemed they could go no further, no matter
what might happen. They looked up at the Ladder
down which they had come, and, to their great surprise,
they could no longer see the top of it; the sides of the
rocky walls seemed to come together above them, just
as they still did below them. It seemed to them that
they were in the middle of the world. They did not
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">115</a></span>dare to try to climb back again, for they were too tired.
They also feared to go any further down, because that
took them further away from their mother and from
the only sort of world which they had ever known. As
they realized the situation into which their eagerness
had brought them, they both began to cry.</p>

<p>This was a very sad situation for the Twins, but
it shows how very hard it always is to get into the secret
places where the Fairies live. If it is not hard in one way,
it always is in another. Just at this time, however,
help came to Zuzu and Lulu in a way which they did
not expect. The Enchanted Banjo began to play a
tune of a very cheerful sort, which ran something like
the following words, as nearly as can be told:</p>

<p class="ptitle">THE JEALOUS JUMPING JACK</p>

<div class="poetry"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">There was a Jealous Jumping Jack<br /></span>
<span class="i2">That told the other Toys:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"None of you has my clever knack&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">You're only good for noise."<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The Humming Top, the Horn, the Drum,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">The Bell, and Talking Doll,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He told: "You screech and clang and hum&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">You can not jump at all!"<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">They looked at him in great surprise<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And did not answer back,<br /></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">116</a></span><span class="i0">And then great rage began to rise<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Within the Jumping Jack.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Now, look at me!" he cried, and humped,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And pulled his legs 'way down,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then gave a spring and madly jumped<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Away, out of Toytown.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">The Horn blew loud, the Red Top hummed,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">The Talking Doll called: "Stop!"<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The Bell rang, and the gay Drum drummed,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">But still he would not drop.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The Jumping Jack jumped on and on<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Although for him they yearned;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They know not where 'tis he has gone&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">He never has returned.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">They say&mdash;but I don't think it's true&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">That little girls and boys<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sometimes grow rudely jealous, too,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">As do some foolish Toys.<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>Zuzu and Lulu were very much encouraged at hearing
the Banjo once more, and so they dried their tears.</p>

<p>"Cheer up, my young friends," said the Banjo, "and
look about you. To me it seems very strange that
Twins with Royal Hereditary Hair should not be able
to see the resting-place cut here in the rock."</p>

<p>Zuzu and Lulu both looked about them, and there,
in the face of the rocky wall along which the Golden
Ladder hung suspended, they saw a little room or cave,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">117</a></span>and to this there led from the Ladder a sort of platform
made up of rungs or rounds. Very quickly they
stepped over this short horizontal ladder and sat down
in the shade of the chamber into which they stepped.</p>

<p>"Dear me," said Lulu, "my arms are tired. I don't
believe I could have carried this basket another minute."</p>

<p>"And my feet," said Zuzu, "are nearly cut in two
by the rounds of the Ladder. This Dragon's leg is very
heavy, and, now that I think of it, I don't see why I
carried it at all, for when one stops to reason it out,
there seems very little use in the wooden leg of a Dragon
for any one but the Dragon itself. Let us leave it here
and take it up when we go back."</p>

<p>"That would be a sensible thing," said Lulu. "I
think it also would be very sensible if we ate our lunch
now, for then the basket would be much lighter."</p>

<p>They ate their lunch, which tasted very good, as they
were hungry after their long climb.</p>

<p>"Now," said Zuzu, "let us ask the Enchanted Banjo
to play for us again, and perhaps that will make our
hearts lighter also, and then we shall certainly climb
very easily."</p>

<p>So now they placed the two pieces of the Banjo together
again and it began to play for them a lively air, which
had in it some strange things which they had not hitherto
heard.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXII</h2>

<p class="ptitle">THE BUMBLEBEE EXPRESS</p>

<p>The three now sat in a row and were not
unhappy, for their hearts felt very light. At last the
Banjo said: "My young friends, it is not true that
I am a Fairy, although I have told you that I was born
in Fairy-land and that my parents were good Fairies
as well. Now, I did not like to say much to you before
this time, although the truth is that had you not taken
me with you to the Fairy Valley, I could not have gone
there at all."</p>

<p>"How, then, did you come to leave the Valley of the
Fairies?" asked Lulu.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">121</a></span>"Once, long ago," replied the Enchanted Banjo, "I
was taken up to earth by a Black Fairy and left hanging
upon a tree, where I was found by the King of Gee-Whiz,
and later given to his Private Secretary, who always
had to make music every day for his Majesty. There
was no way in which I could escape, and, indeed, I was
always treated kindly, as you know. Now, I will try
to see whether I have forgotten all the speech of the
Fairy Valley. I need not say that it is fortunate that
you brought me along, because, certainly, if you came
through the act of a bad Fairy, you would not be welcome
in the Valley, and there is no telling what might happen
were I not there. But now, if you will put me together
once more and press very lightly upon the strings, I
will try to talk in what is known as the Diamond language,
very small and bright and clear and precious; because
that is the way the voice of a Fairy sounds, as nearly
as any one can describe it."</p>

<p>So now they put the two pieces of the Banjo together
again very gently and pressed very lightly upon the
strings, and very softly the Banjo began to play as they
had never heard it play before; and, indeed, its voice did
sound like a diamond or some other precious stone, as
nearly as they could describe it.</p>

</div></div></div>

<p>Hardly had the last note of this Fairy summons died
away, when there came a soft, whirring sound below them.</p>

<p>"Look!" cried Lulu. They peered over the edge of the
room in the rock far down along the Golden Ladder;
and there, approaching them rapidly, they saw a bright
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">123</a></span>light. A faint click came along the Ladder, as one may
sometimes hear the rails click when a railway train is
far away. Rapidly this light grew more distinct, and
almost at once, with a whizz and a whir about as loud
as ordinarily may be heard across a room, but which in
that place sounded very much louder, there drew up at
the edge of the chamber a strange and wonderful little
coach, such as perhaps no Twins in the world ever saw
before.</p>

<p>It was made of a walnut shell for a body, although
the shell was traced with lines of silver and gold. It
had a canopy over the top, made of such gossamer as
blows upon the air of evenings. Within it were two
seats, each as large as a silver dime, and there was
another seat or high box for the coachman. The coachman
was a small blue grasshopper, who sat very erect
and straight upon his seat and drove with wonderful
skill, holding tight to the lines, which were made of single
strands of silk. The most wonderful of all was the team
which drew this little Fairy coach, for such at once
they saw it was. Its horses were nothing in the world
but great golden bumblebees, with black and yellow
bodies, with fuzzy legs and large, bright, dark eyes,
which shone so clearly that no other lamps were needed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">124</a></span>for the coach. Indeed, it had been their eyes which the
Twins saw as they leaned over the edge; and it was their
strange, steady buzzing which had made the noise they
heard&mdash;a very busy and pleasant sound when bumblebees
are going as fast as these had been. They panted
a little as the coachman pulled them up and drove slowly
into the little room in the rocky wall where the Twins
were sitting. The latter looked at the Fairy coach with
delight, for it was the most beautiful thing they had
ever seen in all their lives. At first they did not know
whether there was any one about the coach but the
driver, but now there stepped down a footman, about
as large as a green house-fly and much resembling one.
With a deep bow, he swung open the door in the side of
the coach as though inviting the Twins to enter. As
he did this, the driver tightened up his reins and the
golden harness of the bumblebee horses jingled and
jangled and tinkled as they began to toss their heads
and champ at their bits, eager to start.</p>

<p>"Dear me," said Lulu, "isn't this the sweetest little
coach in all the world? How fine it must be to be a
Fairy and ride in such a coach as this!"</p>

<p>"What is this, Banjo," asked Zuzu, "and where has
it come from?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">125</a></span>"You must be an extraordinarily ignorant person,"
said the Enchanted Banjo, "not to recognize Queen
Zulena's own private coach, the Bumblebee Express.
But why do you wait? Why don't you get into the coach?
You see the footman is waiting for you."</p>

<p>"Get in?" said Zuzu. "Why, how could we?"</p>

<p>"Yes, indeed," said Lulu. "It is not big enough for
a kitten, let alone Twins of our age."</p>

<p>"You are quite mistaken," said the Enchanted Banjo.
"Her Majesty, the good Queen Zulena, has sent for
you. Do not try to understand everything in the world,
for you are still young and there are many things which
you do not know. So do as I say and step in at once."</p>

<p>To their great surprise, they stepped through the door
with perfect ease and found there was plenty of room
and to spare upon the seats.</p>

<p>While they were settling themselves for the ride the
Enchanted Banjo sang:</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXIII</h2>

<p class="ptitle">TO THE VALLEY OF THE FAIRIES</p>

<p>At once the coachman whirled his little team out
from the small room in the rock, and the coach took its
place between the rails of the Golden Ladder, which now
seemed to resemble the rails of a railroad. They were
headed straight down, and Zuzu and Lulu caught their
breath as the coach dived off and began to drop as fast
as lightning, down and down. But hardly had this
flight begun before, to their great surprise, both lost
their fear of falling, and, indeed, forgot that they were
going in any direction except straight ahead.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">128</a></span>They flew on and on, as fast as a bird and as easily,
the bumblebee horses galloping steadily without stopping
to draw a breath, the coachman flirting his whip now
and then, and the footman sitting up very straight and
stern. The Enchanted Banjo now looked perfectly
happy.</p>

<p>"In this way, my friends," it remarked, "we shall
soon be at the edge of the Valley of the Fairies. Had you
stopped to climb down that Ladder, there is no telling
how long it would have taken you. It might have been
several years, and, indeed, for all I know, you might
have been old persons by the time you got there, and so
have had trouble about getting into the Valley; for
every one knows that children are more loved by the
Fairies than old people."</p>

<p>"How long will it take to get there now?" asked Lulu.</p>

<p>"That is a hard question to answer," replied the
Enchanted Banjo, "but I will sing a little in order to
pass away the time." And so the Banjo sang:</p>

<p class="ptitle">THE CRAB AND THE LOBSTER</p>

<div class="poetry"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">The Lobster and the Crab once met<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Where all the sand was nice and wet,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And bowing nicely, down they sat<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To have a pleasant, friendly chat.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">129</a></span><span class="i0">They talked about the weather; next<br /></span>
<span class="i0">How with their children they were vexed;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then said the Crab: "I often fret<br /></span>
<span class="i0">About the Rules of Etiquette."<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Now I," the Lobster said, "am, too,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Disturbed by it the same as you.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I do not like these folks who say<br /></span>
<span class="i0">One should act thus, or talk this way.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"My nature is, indeed, mine own;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Why, if the King called from his throne<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For me to go ahead, he'd find<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That I should quickly drop behind."<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"I, too," the Crab declared, "am odd,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And at some formal laws I nod.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In this one thing I take great pride:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When I walk straight, I step aside."<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Oh, children, pray take heed of this&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">You, little boy; you, little miss&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The Lobster and the Crab do thus<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Because they are like most of us.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">The Crab goes on in sidewise tracks<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And when the Lobster leads, it backs!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They do so, for it is, you know,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The only way that each can go.<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>"We are now in a land where things are not measured
as they are in your world," said the Banjo. "You saw
how easily you got into this small coach, did you not?
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">130</a></span>Its measurement is not the same as that of a coach up
there," and it pointed directly above. "In the same
way, the time will be much smaller than the same length
of time would be where we came from. I don't think
the journey will tire you in the least, but it may, perhaps,
be a sensible thing for you to curl up on the seats and
take a little nap."</p>

<p>"That is so," remarked Lulu. "I am feeling rather
sleepy."</p>

<p>"So am I," said Zuzu.</p>

<p>So they both curled up on the seats and went fast
asleep.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXIV</h2>

<p class="ptitle">THE ROYAL AND OFFICIAL COUNCIL</p>

<p>In the meantime, as may readily be imagined, there
was a sad time at the palace of the King of Gee-Whiz.
The Widow Pickle threatened to upset the royal household
if her Twins were not brought back before sundown
of that day. No trace could be found of the royal shadow,
nor could any one tell what had become of the wooden
leg of the Royal Army. The Private Secretary was
almost frantic over all these difficulties, and the Court
Physician was also at his wits' end, seeking for some
remedy for the strange disease of the King, which had
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">132</a></span>caused him to lose his shadow, this being a thing which
he could not find mentioned in any of the medical works
which he habitually consulted.</p>

<p>"Oh, my poor head! My poor head!" said the King.
"And to think that my poor, dear shadow may have
quite as bad a headache for all I know! Oh, dear, was
ever so unhappy a King as I! Jiji, play for me, and see
if you cannot do something to settle my poor nerves."</p>

<p>The Private Secretary went into his apartment, but
presently returned and fell prostrate upon his face.
"O, King," cried he, "I am the most wretched servant
that ever disappointed a royal master!"</p>

<p>"Why, what is the matter now? What is the matter?"
asked the King. "Has anything else gone wrong?"</p>

<p>"O, King," said the Private Secretary, "I regret to
say that the Enchanted Banjo has disappeared from my
apartments in the royal palace."</p>

<p>"Ah!" cried the King of Gee-Whiz, as he heard the
news. "This is almost too much! I begin to feel so
strange that I really think I shall have to send for the
Court Headsman."</p>

<p>As the King of Gee-Whiz said this, he fixed a stern
eye upon the unfortunate Private Secretary; who, as
must be plain to all, had not been in the least to blame
for any of these unhappy events.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">133</a></span>"I beg to suggest, your Majesty," said the Private
Secretary, "that you send for the Court Detective
instead."</p>

<p>"If in your opinion he can be of the slightest service,"
replied the King, "then pray have him come and set to
work at once."</p>

<p>So the Court Detective came and was admitted to the
presence of the King. He was an oldish looking man,
thin, and dressed in a long, flowing, black gown. He
carried under one arm a large book, and under the other
a basket of plaster-of-paris, with which he was accustomed
to think he would some day make a cast of the
footprints of some escaping criminal. On his nose he
wore two pairs of spectacles, one for far looking and one
for close looking, and in general he was a very wise-appearing
man. The King at once explained to him
the reasons for his summons to the palace, and at that
the Court Detective became even more wise.</p>

<p>"I see, your Majesty," he remarked, "you have lost
your shadow. Ha! Hum! Most serious, most serious,
I assure your Majesty."</p>

<p>"And the Widow has lost the Royal Hereditary
Twins," continued the King.</p>

<p>"Precisely. Most serious, most serious," said the Court
Detective. "It would have been better had I been
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">134</a></span>called much earlier, before the trail was so cold; but we
shall see, your Majesty, we shall see."</p>

<p>"And the Private Secretary has lost the Enchanted
Banjo, upon which we were accustomed to rely for our
entertainment."</p>

<p>"Ah, that is very bad, very bad indeed! Whom does
your Majesty suspect of all these things? Is it your
Majesty's belief that one and the same person has committed
all these crimes?"</p>

<p>"That is for you to tell," said the King.</p>

<p>"Ah! That will render it more difficult," said the Court
Detective, "very much more difficult; but we shall see,
your Majesty, we shall see."</p>

<p>"You will report at the palace at two this afternoon,"
said the King, "and if you have not at that time brought
back the missing articles, your head will be removed
and you will also lose your position as Court Detective."</p>

<p>"Your Majesty," said the Court Detective, "I hope
you will not exercise undue haste. This is the first case
I have ever had, and I should like permission to continue
my studies a little later than two o'clock this afternoon."</p>

<p>"Very well, then," said the King, "you shall have until
half-past two. By that time you must have results."
Whereupon, the King bowed and turned away.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">135</a></span>The Court Detective was very much agitated at these
sudden responsibilities, but he now hastened away.
After sitting for some time in deep thought, he began
to search all about the palace yard, looking for footprints.
In this he was successful, and of every footprint he found
he made a cast in plaster-of-paris; so that before long
he had a basketful of footprints, and with these he
hastened back to the King.</p>

<p>"Your Majesty," he exclaimed, "my eagle eye has
discovered many things, and if my plaster-of-paris had
not run out, I should have been able to show your Majesty
even more footprints than these."</p>

<p>The King was much pleased. "You have a good
mind," said he to the Court Detective. "Among these
footprints I see several which no doubt belong to the
Royal Hereditary Twins. In which direction were they
going?"</p>

<p>"That, your Majesty," replied the Court Detective,
"is something which I did not look into, considering it
immaterial; but now that your Majesty has mixed up
these footprints in the basket, I feel that it will be much
more difficult to determine the course which they were
taking when I discovered them."</p>

<p>The King sent out the Court Detective once more
with instructions to examine closely the ground around
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">136</a></span>the home of the Dragon Jankow, as the Private Secretary
had suggested that they might have gone thither. The
Court Detective declared that if the Twins were found,
the shadow and the lost Banjo also would be discovered;
but he refused to say what made him think this, and only
wagged his head.</p>

<p>Within a short time after he had gone out the second
time, the Court Detective again returned, very much
excited. "Your Majesty, your Majesty," he cried, "a
crime has been committed!"</p>

<p>"Several crimes have been committed," said the King
sternly, "but what is it that you have detected now?"</p>

<p>"The Royal Army has lost its wooden leg."</p>

<p>"Ah," said the King. "Have you just detected that?
I knew that long ago, as also did the Dragon. But
did you find any footprints near there?" asked the King.</p>

<p>"I did not look for any," said the Court Detective;
"but had I found any I should have been helpless, for
I was quite out of plaster-of-paris. But I discovered
that a portion of a sandwich and two tins of preserved
herring had been left near the opening of the gorge where
the Royal Army lives."</p>

<p>"Ah," said the King, "let us see them."</p>

<p>"Your Majesty," said the Court Detective, "I regret
very much to state that I was hungry and ate the sandwich
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">137</a></span>and the tinned herring; but if I had had more
plaster-of-paris, I could have made you an excellent
cast of the tins."</p>

<p class="caption">The King could bound as high as the tallest palms&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>Page 99</i></p>
</div>

<hr class="tb" />
<p>"It seems to me," said the King, "that you are not
really accomplishing much toward taking the criminals."</p>

<p>"But, consider, your Majesty," said the Court Detective,
"the handicap under which I labor. A detective without
plaster-of-paris is almost helpless, and there is no more
plaster-of-paris on the Island. This which I have used
was left to me by my father, the Court Detective to your
Majesty's grandfather, and it was a most superior article,
which can not be replaced."</p>

<p>At this time the King looked at the palace clock.
"Very well," said he, "it will not matter, for, as I perceive,
it is now half-past two; so I presume I may as
well behead you now."</p>

<p>"Your Majesty," said the Court Detective, "I respectfully
request that you do not behead me."</p>

<p>"I am sure you can do quite as well without your
head," said the King.</p>

<p>"No," replied the Court Detective, "that I respectfully
deny, your Majesty; and I request that you leave
the matter of the legality of my execution to the Court
Lawyer. I maintain that the lack of plaster-of-paris
is the cause of my failure, and that lack was not my
own fault."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">138</a></span>"Oh, very well," said the King, "I always wish to be
just. Send for the Court Lawyer, and let us ask him
about it; though thus far I can not see that we have
learned more than we knew before."</p>

<p>The Private Secretary went after the Court Lawyer,
who was asleep in his office, but who awoke and accompanied
him to the palace. The Court Lawyer was a
small man, but very wise indeed. He, too, was old
and he, too, wore a long, flowing robe of black, and a
high, pointed hat with narrow rim, which made him
look taller than he really was. He carried a black bag
under his arm, in which were many wise and learned
books of the law. To him the King of Gee-Whiz stated
the case as it had been submitted, saying that he would
very much like to behead the Court Detective, but that
he did not wish to do anything illegal.</p>

<p>"What do you think in regard to this," asked the King,
"and how quickly can you give me a decision upon this
question of law?"</p>

<p>"Your Majesty," said the Court Lawyer, "I have
known less knotty questions than this one to remain
in the Courts of Chancery for over a hundred years; but
such is my own great personal skill in this branch of the
law, that I make no doubt I can deliver your Majesty
an opinion of several hundred pages and of great importance
in less than half that time."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">139</a></span>"That," said the King, "is absurd, for it would be of
no use to the Court Detective, if he were beheaded now,
to learn fifty years hence that his execution had been
illegal."</p>

<p>"The law can not take any cognizance of unimportant
details," said the Court Lawyer; "so I do not presume
to enter into any discussion of that point, as I have
had no brief prepared, nor could I have had on such short
notice."</p>

<p>"But can you not guess," asked the King, "and give
us an informal opinion as to whether I can behead this
gentleman, and so go take a nap?"</p>

<p>"Your Majesty," said the Court Lawyer firmly, "the
law is not to be handled in so hurried a manner. I can
make no such hasty decision. I should not undertake
to render an opinion upon this question in less than
fifty years, and then only in case I have received my
proper fee."</p>

<p>"But in case the act should later be found illegal?"
asked the King.</p>

<p>"Then, in that case," said the Court Lawyer, "your
Majesty would be in danger of impeachment proceedings,
which might cause your Majesty to lose your throne."</p>

<p>"It is enough for the King to lose his shadow without
losing his throne," said the King angrily. "Away
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">140</a></span>with you, every one, or, I declare, I shall send for the
Court Executioner and consult with him alone!"</p>

<p>So they all hastily withdrew from the King's presence,
and for the time the matter was allowed to rest. It
may be if the bad Fairy had not stolen the White Cricket,
they might have used the Fairy Telephone and asked
the good Queen Zulena whether any word had been
received there of a missing pair of Twins, a royal shadow,
the wooden leg of a Dragon, and an Enchanted Banjo.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXV</h2>

<p class="ptitle">THE FAIRY CITY OF ALMALENA</p>

<p>In the meantime, as may be supposed, the twins Zuzu
and Lulu were rapidly approaching the secret Valley of
the Fairies. They did not know how far they had traveled
when at length they awoke. The Bumblebee Express
had stopped suddenly.</p>

<p>"Well," said the Enchanted Banjo, "here we are at
last at the city of Almalena."</p>

<p>The Twins sat up on the carriage seat and rubbed
their eyes, scarcely believing that what they saw was
anything but a wonderful dream, so strange and beautiful
seemed everything here in the land of the Fairies.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">142</a></span>Before them lay the city of Almalena, shining in some
strange clear light, which was strong as the light of the
sun and yet soft as the light of the moon. In this
radiance one could see to any distance at a glance and
with perfect distinctness. The houses on the farther
side of the Fairy city were as clearly visible as those close
at hand.</p>

<p>The houses were all of some shining substance, possibly
of gold, but it did not hurt the eyes to look at them, for
here everything was soft and gentle. They could see
long streets of these houses; and crossing the streets
were boulevards and parks and open spaces filled with
beautiful trees and flowers. The sweet voices of birds
filled all the air, but did not prevent the hearing of every
other sound distinctly. Here and there tall towers arose,
and at the top of each of these was a large diamond,
whose light made the radiance which was noticeable
everywhere. There were very many spires and pinnacles
and lace-like carvings in what seemed to be stone, but
which may have been this Fairy material resembling gold.</p>

<p>The city of Almalena was not a city as we know it.
There was no smoke anywhere at all, nor any chimneys.
There was no confusion or hurry, nor any jostling nor
crowding nor noise. The streets were paved with soft
woven carpets, and although many wheeled vehicles
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">143</a></span>were darting here and there, drawn by bees or butterflies,
these made not the slightest noise, except that now
and then one could hear the faint tinkling of golden
harness, like that on the steeds of the Bumblebee
Express. All was sweet and calm, and always arose
sweet music, and always there came the feeling that
here it was neither hot nor cold, but comfortable; and
always there lay wide and fine the avenues of the
Fairy city lined with pleasant trees; and always through
the soft air came the tinkling of many little silvery bells,
very sweet to hear, as unseen hands rang them in the
lacy towers.</p>

<p>Beyond the city lay a wide lake, shining in the Fairy
sunlight, and wrinkled with little ripples about as large
as one's hand. This lake was dotted here and there
with little boats that sailed merrily over the tiny waves.
Others went by oars, and yet others seemed to glide
without being propelled in any visible way. Beyond
this lake was the thin dark line of a wide forest, and at
one side of this rose a high mountain, while at the other,
very far away, as it seemed, rose two other mountains
which came close together in a sort of gateway between
the hills. Closer at hand upon the lake were floating
islands upon which grew trees and flowers, and which
seemed also to have people upon them, since now and
then came sounds of laughter and of happy voices.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">144</a></span>Above all in the city of Almalena there was a great
feeling of happiness and content. You might look over
all that valley inch by inch, and listen hour by hour
and never would you hear a complaint or a cry; nothing
except smiles and happy words and cheerful songs and
pleasant voices, and musical instruments which spoke
only of joy and pleasure. This, indeed, is the great
thing about the home of the Fairies, that there everything
is happy, and that such a thing as grief or unhappiness
is unknown.</p>

<p>"This," said Lulu, "is the most beautiful place I ever
saw, and it far surpasses anything of which I have even
dreamed."</p>

<p>"Now since we are here safe and sound," said the
Enchanted Banjo, "it is our first duty to go to see the
Fairy leader, the good Queen Zulena. I am sure you will
say there was never so beautiful and good a queen in
all the world. You may drive us to the royal court of
the Fairies, if you please, Coachman."</p>

<p>So the coachman cracked his whip, the bumblebees again
champed at their bits and snorted, then broke into a
gallop that fairly made the little coach fly up the main
street to the Royal Court of the Fairy city of Almalena.</p>

<p>The coach pulled up under the wide porte-cochère
and as Zuzu and Lulu arose from their seats there came
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">145</a></span>out to meet them many servants who aided them to alight
and ushered them into the Royal Court of the Fairy
Queen Zulena. This was in the finest palace of gold
and silver and jewels which can be imagined. Here
presently they saw the Fairy Queen.</p>

<p>She was a very beautiful queen, this ruler of the
secret Valley of the Fairies. This Zuzu and Lulu saw as
she arose from her throne to meet them. She seemed
about as tall as Lulu, although it is hard to tell just how
tall any person is in the Fairy country, where measurements
are not the same as with us. She was robed in
white and silver, and wore a crown of shining little
diamonds which glittered beautifully. Her throne was
about as tall as a library chair, and was placed on a little
platform raised a distance above the floor. The arms
of the throne were richly carved and about the back
and along the arms were set many great red stones which
made a warm light. Around the foot of this throne
fell the folds of the Queen's garments, and as she rose
and swept back these long robes there stepped out,
from recesses in the wall, one at each side of the throne,
two pages, a boy and a girl, of the same height and size
and expression. Zuzu and Lulu looked at these in
wonder and realized that they also were Twins. These
twin pages carefully took up the robes of the Queen
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">146</a></span>and stood at the edge of the platform. As Zuzu and
Lulu gazed at these pages, to their great surprise they
observed that they had hair of malazite blue and corazine
green, just as they themselves had; only in the case of
the pages, the boy, whose name they learned was Fofo,
had the blue hair, and the girl, whose name was Fifi,
had green, these colors being the reverse of those in their
own case.</p>

<p>The Queen stepped down from her beautiful throne
and caught Lulu and Zuzu in her arms. "My dear
children!" said she. "My dear children, how glad I am
to see you! And here, too, is my good Banjo, that used
to play for us long ago, before we lost it. Ah! I see
these new friends of mine have the royal malazite and
the corazine hair, and they are the images of yourselves,
my dear pages, Fofo and Fifi! These are royal children
who have come to visit us, and I am sure all this is as
much as any Fairy Queen could ask. I hope that my
new friends will shake hands with these my pages, and
that you all will be very good friends."</p>

<p>So the little pages stepped forward from the foot of
the throne, Lulu and Zuzu shook hands with Fofo and
Fifi and soon they were very good friends.</p>

<p>"Now," said the Fairy Queen, "we will have some cakes
and tea, for I know you must be very weary from your
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">147</a></span>long ride. And as you eat, I will have some shadows
dance on the palace wall for your entertainment. I am
sure the Enchanted Banjo will play for the shadows,
because they can always dance very much better to
the music of an Enchanted Banjo."</p>

<p>So then the shadows began to dance on the wall for
them, as the Banjo played:</p>

<p class="ptitle">THE DANCE OF THE SHADOWS</p>

<div class="poetry"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">When the firelight flickers brightly<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Then we see upon the wall<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Shadows bowing all politely,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">When the ruddy blaze is leaping<br /></span>

<h2>CHAPTER XXVI</h2>

<p class="ptitle">THE JOURNEY TO CANDY-TOWN</p>

<p>After they had eaten all their fairy cakes and tea&mdash;which
were not in the least like anything they had ever
tasted before, but were much better than anything they
had ever known&mdash;Zuzu and Lulu told the Fairy Queen
about their journey and how they had happened to
undertake it. They told her what the Black Fairy
had said to them, and how they had taken off the wooden
leg of the Dragon, and how they had started down the
Golden Ladder. Neither Zuzu nor Lulu had heard of
the King's losing his shadow, but in some way the Fairy
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">150</a></span>Queen had heard of this, and now she told them of it,
to their great surprise.</p>

<p>"This," said she, "was the work of the Wicked Fairy
Gobo, whom I have warned never to interfere in matters
outside of his own home in yonder mountain. Had you
only telephoned to me by the White Cricket instead of
the Black Cricket, all would have been well, for in that
case I should have sent the Bumblebee Express quite
up to the top of the ladder for you, and should have
commanded the Dragon to let you pass; but at any
rate, here you are, my dears, and I think no one will
be the worse off for that, except the Wicked Fairy Gobo,
who knew very much better than to use the Fairy Telephone
Line. Him I shall punish for this act in due time.
But we must not be angry or unhappy over these
things. After you have finished your supper, we will
have a short sail upon the lake, and make a visit to some
of the floating islands."</p>

<p>So they all went out sailing upon the Fairy lake, in a
beautiful pale-green boat, which moved very gently
through the water under the oars of a crew of Fairy
dwarfs, who used oars made of wheaten straws, rowing so
gently that the boat hardly made a ripple on the water.
They had also a sail of white silk, which was hoisted at the
bow of the boat, and which was filled by a gentle wind
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">151</a></span>that blew across the lake. The Queen sat on the high
seat at the stern of the boat, with Lulu and Zuzu at her
feet. After some time they landed at the edge of one
of the floating islands, which the Twins were sure was
one of the most beautiful places they had ever seen in
all the world.</p>

<p>As they moved from the shore they found themselves
in a grove of trees, and a short distance ahead in this
grove they saw gleaming the sides of a sort of small
temple, surrounded by a fence. To their great surprise
they found that this fence was built of red and white
and blue rails, laid up like any rail fence; but that these
rails were sticks of candy instead of wood.</p>

<p>"Come now, my children," said the Fairy Queen,
"and let us be seated at yonder temple or kiosk, and have
some more cakes and tea." So they all went to a little
table in the kiosk, and the Queen touched a tiny bell.
Some very small Fairies brought cakes and tea of the
finest sort imaginable, of which it seemed they could
not eat so much as to injure themselves, and which no
matter how much they ate always tasted as good as they
had before.</p>

<p>"Now," said the Queen, "I see that you still have
the Royal Wishing Wands which the good King of Gee-Whiz
has given to you. Why do you not wish for something,
if there is anything you would like to have?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">152</a></span>"Alas!" said Lulu, "we had but three wishes a week,
and we have used them all up but two. We are saving
those for some important occasion."</p>

<p>"That is very nice of you," said the Queen, "but now
let me assure you that your Wishing Wands are meant
for use in the kingdom of Gee-Whiz, and not in the
kingdom of the Fairies. While you are with me you can
have anything you like as often as you like, by only
wishing for it, if I am not mistaken in thinking that my
Fairies are able to do anything I ask of them."</p>

<p>"I wish," said Zuzu, "that I had a sled that would
run up hill."</p>

<p>"A very good and sensible wish," said the Queen,
"and one which is easily granted. Here is your sled,
with your name on it in nice red color, and with low
sharp runners; and I assure you it will run up hill just
as well as down; which has never been the case in your
country, and which is a great objection to all sleds used
there."</p>

<p>"Now," said Lulu, clapping her hands and jumping
up and down, "we must have some snow! But I wish
it could be warm snow, for cold snow is not pleasant,
and makes one's hands red."</p>

<p>Again the Queen smiled and waved her wand and lo!
as she did so soft snow began to fall all about
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">153</a></span>them, so that the ground was soon quite white. Almost
afraid to test it, Lulu put her hand into the snow, but
withdrew it again with a cry of delight. To her great
surprise the snow was quite warm and nice.</p>

<p>"I think you will find this sort of snow very comfortable,"
said the Queen.</p>

<p>"I don't see how anything so cold as snow can be
warm," said Zuzu, only half believing that this could
be true.</p>

<p>"You do not remember," said the Fairy Queen, "that
this country is more or less tropical, so that here snow
might be expected to be warm."</p>

<p>"At any rate," said Zuzu, "I find it very nice, and
with a sled that runs up hill, and snow that does not
get cold, I don't see what more any one could ask. I
don't think I'll wish any more, because I can't think of
anything to wish."</p>

<p>"I know what I'd like!" cried Lulu.</p>

<p>"And what is that, my dear?" asked the Queen.</p>

<p>"I'd like a doll."</p>

<p>"What sort of doll, my dear? We have many very
fine ones."</p>

<p>"I'd like a new doll&mdash;no, I wouldn't, because that
would be leaving my old dolly, and I am sure I like my
old dolly as much as I could any new one, yet I want a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">154</a></span>new one, too. Now, what can I do, when I want both
a new doll and an old one?"</p>

<p>"That is very easy," said the Queen. "I will get you
a doll which is both old and new." And again she waved
her wand.</p>

<p>Lulu looked down, and almost cried aloud; for there
in her arms was a brand new doll, the finest she had ever
seen, that could laugh and talk and eat, which was
quite new, but which, to her great surprise, was also
quite old! She felt free to love it quite as much as she
liked, and so she did love it very much. As she stood
with the doll in her arms, to her great surprise the Enchanted
Banjo began to play and the doll began to
sing, and the song it sang was called:</p>

<p>"I am very happy here, indeed," said Lulu, "and I
can't think of another thing to wish. I feel a little
thirsty from eating so much cake."</p>

<p>The Queen smiled again. "There is no need to wish
for a drink," said she, "for if you will only take a cup
and step to the spring, I think you will find that it is
made of very good lemonade."</p>

<p>So Lulu took her cup, stepped to the spring, and
to her great surprise she dipped up a cup of what proved
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">156</a></span>to be the very best lemonade she had ever tasted in all her
life.</p>

<p>"Now," said the Queen, "suppose we walk farther
into the island, and see what we call our Candy Land."</p>

<p>So they walked on deeper into the wood, and as they
did so they looked all about them, and behold! all the
trees were Christmas trees, hung full of shining things&mdash;toys
and books and parcels, everything most inviting
in appearance. Not one Christmas tree was there, but
hundreds, and every way they looked they saw still
more Christmas trees, so many they could hardly count
them in a day, had they done nothing else but count.</p>

<p>"This," said the Queen, "is what we call the Christmas
tree forest. It is here that Santa Claus, one of my
best friends, gets all the Christmas trees which he uses
in the winter-time. They grow here in hundreds, and
of just the right size. But that is only a part of what
I was going to show you."</p>

<p>Now they came to a long row of houses like shops,
in two rows like the shops in what is called an Arcade;
but to their great surprise everything they saw here was
made of candy. The houses, the people and everything
in the shops proved to be made of candy. There
was nothing in the world one could have thought of which
was not there, and one might have furnished a large house
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">157</a></span>from top to bottom; but every article was made of
candy&mdash;candy rocking-chairs and tables and pianos,
and knives and forks, and everything else, so that Lulu
and Zuzu hardly knew what to do, it all seemed so strange
to them.</p>

<p>"These things are not so durable as though made of
gold or gems," said the Fairy Queen, "because one is
always tempted to eat off the arm of a chair or to bite
a piece out of the table or the clock. But you need
not mind about that; bite all you please, for there are
plenty more of these things. The good Candy Man will
bring more, I am sure, for that is why we have him here."</p>

<p>So Lulu and Zuzu sat down in candy chairs at a candy
table, and soon there came up to them a quaint looking
little man whom they knew to be the Candy Man. He
smiled and smiled as he approached. "You will excuse
me, my good young friends," said he, "if I do not come
and sit down with you, but you see I am made of
candy, and if I get too near the fire my face melts, so I
have to be very careful. But if you see anything here,
help yourselves, and I will get some more for you, if
you like."</p>

<p>As they looked at the Candy Man, the Twins observed
to their surprise that he had only one arm. "Oh! poor
man," said Lulu, "you have only one arm. That's
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">158</a></span>too bad. Will you tell us how you happened to lose your
arm? Did you fall down and break it?"</p>

<p>"No," said the Candy Man, "I did not break it, but
lost it; and yet though I lost it, I still have it, so that
though I miss it, I do not regret it."</p>

<p>"Why, how can that be?" inquired Lulu.</p>

<p>"Well, the truth is," said the Candy Man, "I ate it."</p>

<p>"How awfully sad!" exclaimed Lulu.</p>

<p>"Not in the least, my dear," the Candy Man said.
"Such events are not unusual in this country. If you
think I am badly off, you ought to see my brother. Did
you never hear the story about when he was a boy? Ask
the Banjo."</p>

<p>So the Banjo told them the story.</p>

<p class="ptitle">THE CANDY BOY</p>

<div class="poetry"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Oh, list to the tale of the Candy Boy&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">The boy that turned to candy.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He was his mamma's pride and joy,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And sweet things were too handy.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He ate and ate and ate and ate<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Mint sticks and peanut brittles&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Just candy, it is sad to state,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Made all of this boy's victuals.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">One day he noticed that his hair<br /></span>

<span class="i0">And that upon his fingers there<br /></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">159</a></span><span class="i2">Were bright red stripes a-gleaming.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He bit his finger, and he found<br /></span>
<span class="i2">That it was flavored sweetly<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From having candy all around<br /></span>
<span class="i2">He'd turned to it completely!<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Oh, dear! Oh, dear! This tearful tale<br /></span>
<span class="i2">I really should not finish.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He ate his arms without a wail<br /></span>
<span class="i2">At seeing them diminish.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From eating so much candy, see<br /></span>
<span class="i2">How things resulted direly:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That boy is no more here, for he<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Ate up himself entirely!<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>"Is there anything more that you would like?" asked
the Fairy Queen after this entertaining story.</p>

<p>"No," said Lulu, sighing and hugging tight her new-old
doll. "I am so happy and contented that I can not
think of anything else to wish for myself; but I was
just thinking how badly the poor King must be feeling
all this time without his shadow, while here are we, to
whom he gave these Fairy Wishing Wands, having so good
a time. I wish he could be happy and contented, too."</p>

<p>"Ah, so do I," said the Fairy Queen Zulena. "I
have wished that for many years."</p>

<p>The Twins looked at her and for the first time they
saw a shade of sorrow cross her sweet face. "The truth
is, my children," said the Fairy Queen, "I have often
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">160</a></span>wanted again to see the King. Once, very long ago,
we were children here together in this country, until he
fell partly under the influence of Wicked Fairies and began
to care more for gold and jewels and the like than for
anything else. It was the Wicked Fairies who changed
his nature; but I am always hoping that he will grow
to be a great and good king even yet, so that we may
together rule over the same land."</p>

<p>"Why," said Zuzu, "that is precisely what the King
has said to us very many times!"</p>

<p>The face of the Fairy Queen flushed a little at this,
but she sighed. "Alas, I think that can not be," she
said. "True, I aid him as I can, and whenever he telephones
to me for gold, I give it to him, because certainly
we have more gold than we can use, and many gems as
well; but I can not go up to the Island to meet him,
and so can only telephone, which I do not find wholly
satisfactory. Against certain Wicked Fairies not even I,
the Queen, can prevail in all cases. Thus, I am sad to
say, I could not even secure the King's shadow from the
Wicked Fairy Gobo, if it be true that he has taken it
and hidden it at his cave in the mountain. That could
only be done by a good child who wished it very hard,
and who used the Wishing Wand which is proper for the
Island of Gee-Whiz, where the shadow came from."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">161</a></span>"Ah!" cried Zuzu, "then that is precisely what I
shall wish next." So he rubbed his own Wishing Wand
very hard, and besought that the King should have back
his shadow again, and never more lose it.</p>

<p>"That," said the Queen, smiling now happily, "is
very kind of you, and I am sure if only we can find the
shadow here in the valley, the Wicked Fairy will be
obliged to let it go. It is quite likely that he has also
taken the White Cricket of the King. If we could
restore both of these to the rightful owner, I should be
very happy and contented myself."</p>

<p>"But what shall we do to-morrow?" asked the
Queen of the Twins as she arose and started out from
the Candy Man's place.</p>

<p>"I should above all things like to see the place where
the Fairies find all the gold," said Zuzu.</p>

<p>"Very well," said the Queen, "we will go to-morrow,
and I will show you where all the gold comes from; but
now let us go back to the palace, and go to sleep for the
night."</p>

<p>As she spoke, she again touched a little bell, and soon
there came a little Fairy, smiling and bowing before her.</p>

<p>"Dimi," said the Queen, "please to have the wind
changed so that it shall blow back toward the city,
instead of in this direction. We must be going home
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">162</a></span>now, and I do not wish my oarsmen to become at all
weary."</p>

<p>Dimi bowed and smiled, with his hands spread wide
apart, and as the Twins and the Fairy Queen now walked
down toward the Fairy-boat, to their great surprise Lulu
and Zuzu saw that the wind was beginning to blow gently
and softly in the opposite direction. Soon they were
gliding silently and steadily over the crystal waves of
the Fairy sea.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXVII</h2>

<p class="ptitle">THE VALLEY OF GOLD</p>

<p>That night Zuzu and Lulu slept in golden beds with
silken curtains, with pillows made of thistle-down, very
light and soft. Naturally they slept very soundly, so
it was morning almost before they knew it. When they
arose they saw standing near by golden basins filled
with clear shining water, and after they were bathed
and dressed they saw standing near a little Fairy
with a dainty breakfast-tray. They ate heartily, and
presently hastened away to see the good Queen Zulena
and to remind her of her promise to show them the
Valley of Gold.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">164</a></span>"Come then, my dears," said the Queen, "bring with
you the Enchanted Banjo and we will take the Bumblebee
Express, and travel beyond the forest, toward yonder
mountains."</p>

<p>In a few minutes they heard the tinkle of the golden
harness and the stamp of the bumblebees on the pavement,
eager to be off. Then, taking their seats as before,
off they went through the air, flying as straight and fast
as the strongest bumblebees can go.</p>

<p>"Let me tell you one thing, my children," said the
Fairy Queen, "and it is this: No matter what you see,
you must not tell any person where the Valley of Gold
is to be found. That is a secret which we Fairies have
guarded for thousands of years, and you must by no
means tell of it."</p>

<p>So both Zuzu and Lulu promised, and ever since they
have kept their word; and what is told here is told only
that you may know how wonderful a place it is, and what
strange things are to be seen there; but no one can tell
you how to get there unless you may be fortunate enough
to find a White Cricket and ask of it the way. And, as
White Crickets are very few and hard to find, so there
are very few children who ever really see Fairy-land,
and most children are obliged only to read about it in
the stories of those who have really been there.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">165</a></span>"When we telephoned," said Zuzu, "we got the wrong
kind of Cricket, and had it not been that we had the
Enchanted Banjo with us, we might have met all sorts
of trouble. We thank you, good Queen, for not punishing
us; but we should like to know how the really-truly
Fairy Telephone would be."</p>

<p>"Good Banjo," said the Fairy Queen, "can you not
tell these dear young people how the really-truly Fairy
Telephone goes?"</p>

<p>"With the greatest of pleasure, your Majesty," replied
the Banjo, with a smile. And then it sang:</p>

<p class="ptitle">TO TELEPHONE TO FAIRY-LAND</p>

<div class="poetry"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">If you want to telephone to Fairy-land<br /></span>

<span class="i0">It's a very simple thing to understand,<br /></span>

<span class="i4">Take a candle; go alone;<br /></span>
<span class="i4">Find the Fairy Telephone&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But first have a snow-white Cricket in your hand.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Hello! Hello! Is this the land of Fairies?"<br /></span>
<span class="i4">"Hello! Hello!" A voice will come to you<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From one whose eyes are blacker than blackberries&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i4">"Hello! Hello!" Now talk an hour or two.<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>"Well," said Lulu, "that is certainly very nice. Now
I shall always know how to talk to the Fairies over the
really-truly Fairy Telephone; so that, good Queen,
even although we are very far apart, I shall always call
up and talk to you, no matter where I am, almost every
day of my life."</p>

<p>"Thank you, my dear," said the Fairy Queen, "that
will be very nice, and I do not want you to forget me.
Now we will go and I will try to show you some more
things about our country.</p>

<p>"Here you will see by the roadside many little houses
like smith shops, with tiny white smoke coming out of
each. This is where my little dwarf Fairies are at work
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">167</a></span>making diamonds, very clean and white, among the most
beautiful stones of all, as many think. But beyond
these houses are those where the most skilful of my
workmen are making the stones which we prize more
than diamonds, those whose color is that of your hair,
my dears, the royal blue malazite and the precious green
corazine, the like of which can be found nowhere else
in all the world. We will ask for some of these to take
with us."</p>

<p>Then as she spoke there came out from one of the houses
a little Fairy with his hands full of these precious blue
and green stones.</p>

<p>"Good morning, your Majesty," said he, "I knew you
would like to see some of our work to-day, for these are
among the finest we have ever produced." As he spoke
he placed in her hands some shining, trembling drops of
blue and green.</p>

<p>"These," said the Fairy Queen, "are made from
extracts of the bright blue sky, my dears, and from
the essence of the deep green leaves."</p>

<p>"And did our hair get its color in the same way?"
asked Lulu, wondering.</p>

<p>"That may perhaps be," said the Queen, smiling at
her eagerness. "There are some who think that we come
from the sky and from the trees, and perhaps this is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">168</a></span>true, for ever since even Fairies can remember, there
have been the trees and the sky just as there have been
persons."</p>

<p>The Bumblebee Express soon was progressing again
merrily, and ere long it brought them into a deep depression
between two mountain peaks beyond the forest.
The way here was winding and roundabout. They went
on and on, around and around, deeper and deeper into
the mountains. Now they began to hear strange wild
sounds, roars and deep hoarse voices which reminded
them of that of the Dragon in the Island of Gee-Whiz.</p>

<p>"Those are the faithful watch-dogs of the forest,"
explained the Queen, "lions and tigers and bears, which
would certainly eat up any one who came hither without
my permission. They will be harmless so long as I am
with you, and you need have no fear. In a few moments
we shall be at the gateway to the Valley of Gold."</p>

<p>Before long they paused at what seemed to be the end
of the way. A steep rocky wall rose directly before
them, covered over with growing ivy and with short
thorny plants. On each side of this the mountains rose
quite up to the sky, so that there was no such thing as
getting around on either hand. What was to be done
now Zuzu and Lulu could not guess, but the Queen of
the Fairies did not hesitate.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">169</a></span>She sprang from the seat of the coach and walked
directly up to the wall, upon which she struck sharply
five times with her jeweled parasol handle. "Abra!
Abra! Adabra! Abra! Abracadabra! Open! Open!
Open!" she cried aloud; and her voice was clear and
strong as well as sweet.</p>

<p>Now arose a great grumbling noise within the walls
of rock. Voices were heard shouting, and there came
the sound of heavy clanking and creaking of very heavy
machinery.</p>

<p>"O, Queen!" cried out a deep voice, as it were from
the very bosom of the rock; and the Queen called out:
"Open! Open! Open! It is the Queen!" And as she
did this hoarse voices arose again in unison, and the
groaning of heavy weights and chains continued. At
last, as they sat gazing at the face of the rocky wall, to
their great surprise they saw it open in a tiny crack,
as though it were slowly splitting across. As they looked,
this crack widened steadily before their eyes, and they
saw that a heavy rock which had made a part of the wall
was slowly rising, a little at a time. At last it swung
quite free, and before them lay a passageway through
the rock and the concealing ivy which covered it. No
one in the world would ever have suspected that there
was a door in the face of this rock wall. It may be
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">170</a></span>seen that the Fairies guard their secret very carefully.
Even to this day men frequently pass by the gate into
the valley, not seeing it in the seamless rock, and not
suspecting that they are so near to the great Valley
of Gold.</p>

<p>The Queen now took her seat and motioned to the
coachman to drive on through the gateway. He
did so, and as they went forward they saw a great golden
light flooding out to meet them. They passed between
long rows of dark, fierce-looking warriors, armed with
swords and spears and shields, all dark-bearded and broad-shouldered.
These frowned at the new-comers, but the
Queen raised her hand to restrain them, and the Twins
passed on in safety. As they did so they heard, rattling
and clashing into place behind them, the vast rock of
the gate. And so in this new golden light they looked
about on what no other mortals yet have seen, and what,
in spite of much longing, it is doubtful if any ever
again will see.</p>

<p>They were in the front portion of a deep valley or cleft
in the mountain. On all hands the walls rose sheer and
smooth, without a crack or seam, almost up to the blue
sky, which seemed miles and miles away. Around the
edges of the rocky walls, high above, grew dark forest
trees, but these were so far away that they seemed no
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">171</a></span>larger than one's hand. From these trees to the bottom
of the valley may have been a mile, or perhaps two miles,
if it were possible to get any idea of distances in Fairy-land.
Not in any place on these naked walls was there
a notch or step or foothold of any kind. Across the valley
may have been two miles or three, or perhaps ten or
twenty, so hard was it to tell of such things in
this peculiar golden wavering light which filled all the
place. This light, it was easy to be seen, was the only
one known in the valley, for the entire valley lay in the
shadow, the light from the sky marking the rocky walls
only a little way down from the top.</p>

<p class="caption">&quot;Quick, before the Dragon wakens&quot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>Page 113</i></p>
</div>

<hr class="tb" />
<p>"There is but one hour in the day when the sun shines
into the magic Valley of Gold," said the Queen. "At
dawn, it falls through a notch upon the farther side,
which you can not see from here, and the sunlight enters
the valley for a short time. A path leads to that notch,
it is said, though I myself have never seen it; but it is
fatal to tread that path and to look over into the valley
when the sun shines in; for the great reflection upward
from the Mother of Gold&mdash;this great vein of gold which
runs across the valley and from which comes this golden
light that you see&mdash;is so strong that any one who looks
upon it is at once smitten blind, and may never see again.
So perhaps you may see how difficult it is to find this
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">172</a></span>valley, or even to enjoy it when found; for if you had
all the gold in the world&mdash;even this Madre d'Oro, the
Mother of all the Gold, as the Fairies say&mdash;it would do
you no good, for at once its possession would destroy
all its enjoyment."</p>

<p>Zuzu and Lulu wondered and wondered at all these
things, and were not a little frightened, for on all hands
they still heard groanings and murmurings, and strange
voices deep within the earth.</p>

<p>"Keep close to me, my children," said the Queen,
"and do not fear. Now we shall see the vision of the
Mother of Gold in all its splendor."</p></div>

<h2>CHAPTER XXVIII
</h2>
<p class="ptitle">THE MOTHER OF GOLD</p>

<p>As the Fairy Queen spoke, she descended from the
coach and held out a hand each to Lulu and Zuzu. She
led them onward through a sort of hedge of dense trees
which lay before them, and beyond which there arose
the flickering light, yellow and warm, that had appeared
to color all the air of the Secret Valley. At length
they stepped out in full view of the great source of all
this light, and saw before them the most strange and
wonderful thing they had ever seen in all their lives.</p>

<p>From directly at their feet, entirely across the Valley
as far as they could see, there ran a great ledge or dam
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">174</a></span>of pure gold, which yet did not seem solid, for it seemed
to rise and fall and flutter as though it were almost ready
to melt and flow; but it never did so. This great vein
of gold was many miles in length, so far as they could
tell; and how far back at each end it ran into the foot
of the walls of the Valley no one could tell. Its front
or face broke off like a wall, or rather like the side of
a dam, perhaps fifty feet or more from top to bottom.
Over this ledge or dam, a short distance out toward
the wall of the valley, there flowed a broad river of
clear water, white as crystal, which made a deep pool
below the ledge of gold; and thrusting up through this
sheet of falling water were points of rock which sparkled
like diamonds, or gleamed dull and white like pearls;
and such was the peculiar quality of this great ledge of
seemingly living gold, that, as the water fell over it, it
partly turned into a sort of vapor; and in this vapor,
rising continually and floating away up into the sky, were
thousands of butterflies, all gold and black and green,
floating away upon many-colored bubbles, like soap bubbles,
very light and fine. These came streaming up and up
all the time, and danced out toward the top of the Valley
as far as any one could see. So now Lulu and Zuzu knew
where the butterflies come from in the spring, when they
appear fluttering up from the south to play among the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">175</a></span>flowers. They come from the hidden Valley of Gold;
and the gold they have upon their wings they certainly
get from this great ledge of gold which lies across the
Fairy Valley.</p>

<p>Near to the place where they stood were thousands
of other Fairies working upon the linings of mother-of-pearl
which lined the shells that lay along the ledge.
These also made numbers of the bubbles upon which
the butterflies were floating. So then the Twins knew
where the bubbles come from that we see sometimes;
they are made by Fairies. Again in another place very
many Fairies were making all sorts of beautiful flowers&mdash;blue,
and pink, and crimson, every color in the world,
and both large and small. Upon trees near by, and spread
out upon the rocks also, were numbers of delicate bracelets
and brooches and rings and pins, and all manner of
beautiful and rare things in gold and gems. So now
the Twins knew whence come the bracelets and rings and
ornaments of that kind, which so few people have ever
seen made.</p>

<p>Over all this scene of beauty there arose sweet music,
very peaceful and calm, as though it came from the
bottom places of the earth, of which no one knows more
than a very little, unless one has been in Fairy-land.
All this was so beautiful and strange that the Twins sat
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">176</a></span>down and hardly knew what to do. They watched the
great ledge of the Mother of Gold heave and swell and
sink and rise again, and saw the Fairies making these
beautiful things, and saw flitting across the Valley
beautiful birds with long tails, as long as one's arm, and
with crests as long as one's hand, and with feathers
which seemed of gold and pearl and green and blue; and
the voices of these birds seemed to them the sweetest
they had ever heard.</p>

<p>The Fairy Queen allowed them to sit and look as
long as they liked, and bade them take up all the pieces
of gold and gems and jewels which they liked&mdash;all the
diamonds and other precious stones. "This, my children,"
she said, "is where mortals get their gold and precious
gems. These come from the Fairy Valley. Here it
is that we secure all the gold required by the King
whom you have left behind in the Island, and the gems
in which the King and his friends delight. But since
you have seen this vision of the Mother of Gold, you
must not tell even the King where it is, for in that case
some of his friends might make war upon us, and we
should have to summon from under the earth many of
these fierce warriors whose voices you have heard. For
all the people who live under the earth fight to the last
to conceal this gold from all the rest of the world; and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">177</a></span>that, as you may readily understand, is the reason why
gold and jewels are so hard to get, and why they are by
many considered so valuable.</p>

<p>"Now when you have seen all you wish and when you
feel that you will not need to come again&mdash;for no one
but myself ever twice sees the vision of the Mother of
Gold&mdash;we will go back and look at other things for a
time; but you need not do this until you feel that you
will be very happy and contented to do so."</p>

<p>"I am sure we shall be happy and contented," said
Lulu, "for now we see that what we once thought was
very rare is indeed very abundant, and that to hold much
of it in one's hand does not seem to make one feel much
better than before. See, my hands are full of gold,
and I want no more."</p>

<p>"Then," said the Queen, "since you promise to be
happy and contented, we may go." So saying she
beckoned to the coachman, and the Bumblebee Express
swept up once more, the bumblebees stamping and
champing at their bits. And now again the mighty gate
of stone swung open, and once more it closed behind
them; the savage warriors fell into place behind them;
and after they had passed the gate they heard groans
and murmurs from below and behind them; and then
once more came the roaring of the tigers and the lions
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">178</a></span>which live without the gates and which aid in the guarding
of the treasure. So presently they were flying again
along the crooked road between the mountains, and as
they looked back, to their great surprise they could not
tell which was the mountain pass out of which they had
come; for now there appeared to be several, and they
all looked alike.</p>

<p>"That is just as well," said Zuzu, "for we have promised
to be happy and contented, and not to wish to go back
again to the Valley of Gold."</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXIX</h2>

<p class="ptitle">THE SECRET WISH OF THE FAIRY QUEEN</p>

<p>"Good Queen," said Zuzu to the Fairy Monarch Zulena,
when the Bumblebee Express had finally brought them
back again to the Fairy city of Almalena, "there is
something which perhaps you have forgotten, or which
at least you have not mentioned for some time."</p>

<p>"And pray what is that?" asked the Fairy Queen.</p>

<p>"Why, we have all of us quite forgotten the poor King,
who has lost his shadow."</p>

<p>"Indeed, I have not," said the Queen Zulena; "but,
as I have told you, I can only show you where the Wicked
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">180</a></span>Fairy lives who took the shadow. As that is something
belonging to the country of the Island, I have only
partial power over it. If I should seize upon this shadow
and take it to the palace, there is no one there whom
it would fit; and as to taking it up the Golden Ladder
myself, that is quite out of the question. If I did that
I should be called a very forward Queen indeed; so upon
the whole I hardly know what to do about it, except
to take you upon a visit to the home of the Wicked Fairy
Gobo."</p>

<p>"If it be true that the Wicked Fairy has also taken the
White Cricket," said Lulu, "then the King can not telephone
you any more."</p>

<p>"That is true!" said the Fairy Queen; and to their
great surprise she broke out weeping, the first time
that any such thing had ever happened in all her life.
"I have not heard from the King for many days," she
said; "and now I know that he can never telephone me
again, because certainly the White Cricket which I gave
him has been taken away by this Wicked Fairy."</p>

<p>"But," said Lulu, who also wept at seeing the good
Queen in trouble, "why can we not find this Wicked Fairy
and ask whether he has these things? Perhaps we can
get them back again. I could carry the White Cricket
in my pocket, and Zuzu could carry the shadow, if it
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">181</a></span>were not too large, and so we could manage in some way
to get back up the Golden Ladder, even if your Majesty
could not send us in the Bumblebee Express."</p>

<p>"Could you do that, my dears?" said the Fairy Queen,
"would you be so good as to do these kind things for me?"</p>

<p>"Certainly," said Lulu, "we should be glad to. We do
not want to go away from you, for this is the loveliest
place we have ever seen in all our lives, but mamma will
be anxious about us before long; and since you, too,
would like the poor King to have back his shadow again,
perhaps you would not mind if we go back for a time.
We will come again whenever you telephone and ask us
to do so; for you must know that we have thrones near
the King, and he tells us everything he does. We
should like you to get us past the Dragon, for we might
not be able to get off the Dragon's leg so easily the next
time; and if we did not, there might be all sorts of
trouble."</p>

<p>"But what shall I do without you, my dears?" said the
Fairy Queen. "I wanted you to join my dear little
pages, Fofo and Fifi, at my throne; then I should have
had four pages&mdash;two boys and two girls&mdash;and with the
most beautiful hair in all the world. I love you so much,
my dears, that I can not bear to have you go away."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">182</a></span>"In my opinion," said Zuzu thoughtfully, "the best
way would be for you and the King to make some sort
of arrangement about the Dragon and the Golden Ladder.
In that case it might be easy to turn the two kingdoms
into one. And what is the use of having two thrones,
one here and one there, if one will do quite as well?"</p>

<p>As she heard these words the face of the Fairy Queen
was wreathed in smiles. "How I love you, my dear
boy!" said she. "But, alas!" she added with a sigh,
"that is impossible, I fear. Although I can give wishes
to others outside my kingdom, when I wish anything
for myself outside my kingdom, I have no power."</p>

<p>"But," cried Lulu gleefully, "here are our two Wishing
Wands, given us by the King, and each of them has a
wish left unwished. Will not these two wishes be enough?
See, we shall wish just as you wish, because you have
been so good to us."</p>

<p>"Ah! my children," said the Fairy Queen, trembling
with eagerness, "be careful what you say. Pray do not
wish for anything until I have had time to think! Tell
me, my dears, when you are back in the country of the
King whence you came hither, will you then wish the
wish which I wish also?"</p>

<p>"Truly we will!" they both said in reply.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">183</a></span>"Then I will whisper it to you," said the Fairy Queen;
"but you must not tell any one until you have reached
the palace of the King, and then you may wish it out
plain and strong; and I pray all the Fairies that obey
me to help that wish to come true, for in that case I
myself would always be very happy and contented."</p>

<p>So then the Fairy Queen Zulena bent over and whispered
in their ears the wish that was in her heart.</p>

<p>"Now then," said Zuzu, "let us go to the mountain of
the Wicked Fairy and find the King's shadow."</p>

<p>"Very good," said the Queen, "that is excellent
wisdom, and we shall all start at once." So once again
they stepped into the Fairy coach, and the good Queen
told the coachman to drive beyond the forest to the
mountain where dwelt Gobo, the Wicked Fairy.</p>

<p>The driver cracked his whip, the golden harness rattled
and tinkled, and the wheels of the dainty coach began
to whir as the steady buzz of the bumblebees in flight
began.</p></div>

<h2>CHAPTER XXX</h2>

<p class="ptitle">THE QUEEN RECOVERS THE SHADOW</p>

<p>"Ha! Gobo," cried the Fairy Queen as at last they
drove up before the door of the cave in the mountain
where the Wicked Fairy made his home, "we have come
to question thee about thy evil deeds. Come hither,
and confront thy Queen!"</p>

<p>The Twins had not thought that the gentle Queen
Zulena could be so stern, or that her eyes could flash
as they did when she spoke these words.</p>

<p>"Aye, aye, my Queen," sounded a hoarse voice from
within the cave; and presently in obedience to the order
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">185</a></span>of the Fairy Monarch there stepped into view from the
darkness of the cave the Wicked Fairy Gobo, whose evil
deeds have been recounted in our story. He trembled
as he saw the sternness of the Queen, and began to
stammer and make denials.</p>

<p>"Who hath accused thee, Gobo? Yet now we know
that well mightest thou be accused. Tell me, where hast
thou hidden the shadow of the King, which thou hast
stolen? Where, too, is the servant of the king, the
White Cricket, such as was never found save in the royal
gardens of our palace?"</p>

<p>The Wicked Fairy fell upon his face on the ground,
but even as he did so the Queen raised her hand. There
came very plainly to their ears the chirp! chirp! of something
hidden within the cave.</p>

<p>"I may as well confess," said Gobo; "for that is the
voice of the Cricket you hear. It is of no service to me,
for a more unwilling Cricket I have never seen."</p>

<p>"Bring it to me!" commanded the Queen, and sullenly
Gobo did as he was bidden.</p>

<p>"Here," said the Queen to Lulu, "is the White Cricket.
Pray handle it softly, and let no harm befall it. As for
you, Gobo, Wicked Fairy that thou art, lead us at once
to the hiding-place of that other thing which thou hast
stolen."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">186</a></span>Sullenly the Wicked Fairy walked ahead of them toward
the edge of the wood, and threw open there a little gate.
To their great surprise they saw, standing near the gate,
leaning against a tree in a shady place, nothing less than
the shadow of the King, just as the Wicked Fairy had
stolen it more than a week before!</p>

<p>Of course it must be remembered that this was the
shadow of the King stolen after he had taken the drink
from the rubber tree, and when he was thrice his natural
height and much distorted, in his dance high up in the air.
It looked more like the shadow of some misshapen giant.
As the Queen saw this, tears again came to her eyes.
"It is not like him!" she said mournfully.</p>

<p>"'Tis as I tell thee, Queen Zulena," insisted Gobo,
"for I took the shadow with my own hands, in the broad
daylight, and I know whereof I speak. See, if thou
wouldst prove it, look at the shape of his left forefinger,
where the King wore the royal jewel of malazite and
corazine, engraven by your Majesty's own Fairies."</p>

<p>"Ah! it is indeed true," said the Fairy Queen. "But
how changed! My dears," and she whispered again to
the Twins, "do not forget your wish and mine."</p>

<p>"And now, sirrah!" exclaimed the Queen, "Gobo, Bad
Fairy that thou art, thou must bow before my power!
I know not what punishment may be fit for thee."</p>

</div>

<hr class="tb" />
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">187</a></span>The bad Fairy writhed in the dust and begged for
mercy, promising anything that should be asked.</p>

<p>"First, we must have the shadow of his Majesty,"
said Zuzu.</p>

<p>"Willingly," cried Gobo, "willingly! though perhaps
it may not fit him now."</p>

<p>"Never fear, Gobo," said the Queen Zulena, "we ourselves
shall see to that. So fare ye well, wicked Gobo.
One more such act as this, and our royal guards shall
banish thee to our jail, and fill thy cave to the roof with
stones. From this time your leave to go abroad is revoked
for a thousand years. Here must you remain a prisoner!"</p>

<p>"I crave a thousand pardons, good Queen," begged
Gobo, spreading out his arms in submission. "But
spare me now, and I shall make amends by leading the
life a Fairy should live under so wise and good a Queen
as thou."</p>

<p>"Learn better in the time accorded thee, and ask no
more," said the Queen sternly in reply.</p>

<p>"And now, my children," she continued as she turned
again toward the Twins, "let us take the King's shadow
in the coach, and return to the royal palace. I am sure
that by careful labor I can restore this poor, dear shadow
to its original shape."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">188</a></span>As she spoke she was about to step again into the coach,
when all at once she turned toward the Enchanted Banjo,
as though she had heard it speak.</p>

<p>"What is it, good Banjo?" she asked. "And why
do you laugh as though you would split yourself? Is it
anything you want to tell us?"</p>

<p>"I was just thinking, your Majesty," replied the
Enchanted Banjo, "while we have all been talking about
Wishing Wands and the like, about a funny thing of
that sort that once happened within my own experience.
I made up a song about it the other night, and if you
care to hear it, I will sing it to you."</p>

<p>"Very well," said the Fairy Queen; and so the Banjo
began, in a rich, full voice:</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXXI</h2>

<p class="ptitle">THE MESSENGERS OF THE FAIRY QUEEN</p>

<p>"My dear friends," said the Fairy Queen after they had
arrived once more at the palace, "I must tell you more
about this Wicked Fairy Gobo. He was once one of my
trusted workmen in the valley where you have seen the
Mother of Gold. You know how necessary it is for the
greatest of care and secrecy to be observed by every
person permitted within those walls; for should any unfaithful
servant allow that secret to become known, or
should he leave the gate open, or should he do any one
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">192</a></span>of a hundred dangerous things, then all would be lost.</p>

<p>"Now this is what the Wicked Fairy Gobo did; he
became covetous of the gold which he saw all about him,
and began, as mortals do, to think this gold worth more
than everything else. In short, he was willing to do
anything, if only he might control all this gold. It was
he who planned to open the gates and let in wicked
persons who would have robbed me. My faithful friend
the White Cricket told me of this, and at once I banished
Gobo from the Valley of Gold, and changed the mountains
all about, and made new gates, and secured new
sentinels and guards of the valley; so that Gobo never
again could find the way thither. He has been my
enemy ever since, although hitherto I have never punished
him, beyond confining him to yonder mountain; whence
it was his privilege to emerge twice a year. You see
what he has done. Jealous that I should hear from
the King so often, Gobo has taken the shadow and with
it the White Cricket, so that I could telephone no longer.
Now in order that I may once more hear from the King,
I shall send him back, in your hands, my dears, the
Cricket for his telephone; and I shall send him back also
his shadow, after I have restored it to its proper shape.
And I shall send him also my hope; and I shall send him
the message which I have whispered in your ears."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">193</a></span>"But see the poor shadow, how badly it is bent,"
said Lulu. "It does not look in the least like the King
as we know him."</p>

<p>"I shall hope to be able to straighten out the shadow,"
said the Queen. "It is only the Wicked Fairy who has
destroyed its beauty for the time."</p>

<p>"But," asked Zuzu curiously, "why do you take so
great an interest in the King of the Island of Gee-Whiz?
It always seemed to me that he acted very strangely;
for sometimes he was friendly toward the Fairies and
sometimes not; and often he wanted more gold."</p>

<p>"Ah! that is it," said the Queen, sighing, "it was
always that gold! It was the Wicked Fairy Gobo who put
such notions in his head; but let us hope that all will
yet be well. I beseech you now to hold tight to your
Wishing Wands, and on no account make another wish
until you are in the presence of the King himself.</p>

<p>"But now it is time that you rested after these journeys
through my realm. You may join Fofo and Fifi for a
time in the Fairy gardens, and say good-by to them;
then the best thing you can do is to eat your supper of
cakes and honey, and sleep soundly in readiness for the
journey up the Golden Ladder. It was my wish, as I
have told you, to make you my pages, and to keep you
here in my realm for ever, for you are very good children
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">194</a></span>indeed; but now I love and trust you so much that I
am going to make you my messengers instead of my
pages, and let you go away again for a little time. In
order that you may be happy and contented, perhaps
the Enchanted Banjo will now play for us."</p>

<p>So saying she handed the Enchanted Banjo to Zuzu,
and at once as he and Lulu placed their hands upon the
Banjo it began to sing for them.</p>

<p class="ptitle">FAREWELL TO THE FAIRIES</p>

<div class="poetry"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Farewell, Fairies, gay and good;<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Chanting to us as we pass;<br /></span>

</div></div></div>

<p>Then the Queen bent over each little pillow and spoke
softly:</p>

<p>"Before you fall asleep I shall kiss you each good
night and good-by; for when you awaken you will
be far away."</p>

<p>As she kissed Zuzu and Lulu, they began to feel very
drowsy, but before they had time to reason it out to
themselves, they were both fast asleep. The last thing
they knew was the soft kiss of the Fairy Queen; and
the last thing they saw was the room of the fairy palace,
very beautiful, seeming to fade away and become more
distant and indistinct.</p></div>

<h2>CHAPTER XXXII</h2>

<p class="ptitle">THE RETURN TO THE ISLAND</p>

<p>When they awoke, Zuzu and Lulu rubbed their eyes
very hard, and looked around them in wonder; as,
indeed, well they might. They were now not in the fairy
palace at all, but once more alone, and at the top of the
Golden Ladder, whose long lines they could see far, far
below them, shining like the beams of the sun at evening
or morning. Near by them rose the walls of the rocky
pass in which lived Jankow, the Dragon, and near them
was the end of the tail of the Dragon. They could hear
its harsh voice coming to their ears very plainly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">197</a></span>"Do not be afraid," said Zuzu to Lulu, "for I am sure
that the Fairy Queen will protect us, even though we do
not see her at the moment. We shall be quite safe,
also, because I have the wooden leg of the Dragon; and
here I have the shadow of the King, all straight and fine
and new again; and you have the White Cricket in your
pocket; so I am sure they will all be glad to see us back
again when we tell them where we have been."</p>

<p>At the same time, although Zuzu spoke boldly, both
he and Lulu kept very close to the wall as they edged
along the narrow opening from the top of the Golden
Ladder to the front of the gorge where the head of the
Dragon lay.</p>

<p>The Dragon was engaged in loud roaring as usual, but
his voice was hoarse and weary. Instead of sitting up
straight upon his front feet, he leaned over against the
side of the rock-wall in a very sad sort of way.</p>

<p>"Oh, dear!" said the Dragon to himself&mdash;so loudly that
they heard his words distinctly&mdash;"this is indeed terrible
to have to go through life with but one leg in front.
Some say that as a Dragon has a dozen legs, and a tail
as well, he should not miss a leg here or there, but I am
sure those who say this do not know the real truth.
If only I could get back my leg, I would ask no questions,
I am sure."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">198</a></span>At this Zuzu felt the Enchanted Banjo nudge him in
the side, and guessing what it meant, he stepped forward
boldly.</p>

<p>"Good Dragon Jankow," he said, "here then is your
leg, as good as new. Let us pass, and we shall put back
the leg, so that you can sit up again and see all that is
going on; but we claim your promise, and you must ask
no questions."</p>

<p>The Dragon turned upon him one of its large eyes in
which at first chiefly anger showed; but when its eye
fell upon the wooden leg the Dragon's mouth opened
in a wide smile of joy.</p>

<p>"Is it a bargain?" asked Zuzu.</p>

<p>The Dragon nodded three times, which meant that it
was a bargain; so Zuzu leaned the shadow of the King
against a tree not far away, and, handing Lulu the
Enchanted Banjo, he began at once to screw back in
place the wooden leg of the Dragon.</p>

<p>When he had completed this act the Dragon wriggled
all over with joy, sat up straight in front again, and
gave a loud roar of pleasure.</p>

<p>"Now," it said, "I am something like a Dragon once
more; and let all persons beware of my might. Arrngh!
Arrngh! Arrngh!"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">199</a></span>"I am sure, my good friends," he explained to them,
"you can not understand how much I have missed that
leg. Many persons will tell you that a wooden leg is a
very poor one, but I can assure you that when you have
been used to a wooden leg for several hundred <span class="err" title="original: years'">years</span>
it is a very good leg indeed to have, and one that you miss
very much when it is gone. As you go on toward the
palace, my dear friends, I wish you would inform the
King that his faithful Army is again quite ready for
business, and will defend the Island against all intruders."</p>

<p>Zuzu and Lulu now ran forward through the wood
quite rapidly for a way, but as they approached the
palace their steps began to lag. "Suppose mamma
should want to punish us," said Zuzu. This caused Lulu
to think very hard for a moment.</p>

<p>"It may be that she will," said she finally, "but perhaps,
on the other hand, she too will be glad to have
us back and no questions asked. It seems to me that
the best thing we can do is to have the Banjo play for us.
Perhaps they will forgive us without our asking it, but
we would better ask the Banjo how we can tell about
that."</p>

<p>So again they placed the Banjo in position and once
more it began to play; and it told how one can always
tell whether or not one's mother wants one.</p>

<span class="i0">For if you ask mamma, indeed,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">She'll say: "What? Want you? Yes, I do!"<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>Lulu picked up a big, white, fluffy dandelion, and blew
and blew at the top until all the fluff was gone.</p>

<p>"Ah," said she, "it is plain that mamma will be glad
to see us back again."</p></div>

<h2>CHAPTER XXXIII</h2>

<p class="ptitle">THE HAPPY ENDING OF THE STORY</p>

<p>Now at the royal palace of the King of Gee-Whiz all
was gloom and sadness, as may readily be supposed.
The Widow Pickle had lost more than thirty pounds
in weight from weeping so incessantly; the Private
Secretary was also worn almost to a shadow, while the
Court Physician, the Court Detective, and the Court
Lawyer all confessed themselves on the verge of despair
and in fear of their lives; as by this time they had been
obliged to admit their entire inability to solve the mystery
regarding the disappearance of the Twins, of the Enchanted
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">202</a></span>Banjo, of the shadow of the King, and of the Dragon's
wooden leg. The King himself was by this time very
thin and weary-looking, and took no delight even in
Waffles, while the mere thought of syrup caused him to
shudder. "My life is ruined," said he, "and I shall
never again be happy." This he repeated over and over
again.</p>

<p>"Without a shadow I no longer desire to be King,"
said he at length to the Private Secretary. "Elect a
Council, if you like, and have them make the laws and
do the ruling as they please. I am going to cease being
King, because I am not happy and contented."</p>

<p>It was just at this time that there was heard, far off
in the forest, the sound of the Enchanted Banjo, playing
the air which has been mentioned. At this sound
the King sat up very straight on his throne and began
to listen. At that moment there rushed toward him the
Court Detective, who exclaimed, "Your Majesty! Your
Majesty! I have the honor to report that I have discovered
the Enchanted Banjo!"</p>

<p>"Where?" asked the King.</p>

<p>The Court Detective pointed toward the sound, and
answered, "There!"</p>

<p>"Ah," said the King, "I had discovered that much
myself."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">203</a></span>At that moment the Court Physician hastened up and
exclaimed, "Your Majesty! Your Majesty! I have the
honor to report that you are going to be much better very
soon!"</p>

<p>"Ah!" said the King, "I knew that much myself;"
and he settled his royal waistcoat in front and began to
look interested.</p>

<p>"Your Majesty! Your Majesty!" cried the Court
Lawyer, excitedly running up at this moment, "I have
the honor to report that it will not be necessary to behead
the Court Detective! I have rendered my opinion."</p>

<p>"Indeed?" said the King. "I have just rendered that
opinion for myself."</p>

<p>"Your Majesty! Your Majesty!" cried the Widow
Pickle, also appearing at this moment, quite out of
breath, "I am sure my Twins are coming home."</p>

<p>"Indeed?" said the King. "I was of that belief myself
before you spoke. I beg you all to observe that I am
King on this Island, and I propose now to resume my
reigning for a time, to show that I am King. Yet what,
I should like to ask, do all these matters benefit me,
who am as shadowless as before?"</p>

<p>There was no time to answer him, for at that moment,
to their great surprise, there emerged from the edge of
the forest the Twins, carrying the Enchanted Banjo
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">204</a></span>between them and carrying also their lunch basket and
the shadow of the King. They walked at once directly
in front of the throne and as soon as their mother had
kissed them again and again, they signaled that they
would like the attention of those present.</p>

<p>"Listen!" cried the King of Gee-Whiz, "the Royal
Hereditary Twins of the Island of Gee-Whiz will now
be heard!"</p>

<p>The King's voice was weak because of his longing for
his shadow. He did not suspect it, although it was a
fact, that Zuzu was holding his shadow before him in
plain view. It was so new and handsome a shadow
that the King did not recognize it as his own.</p>

<p>"O King!" said Zuzu, approaching and kneeling
before the throne. And Lulu also came and knelt saying
"O King!" They held the Royal Wishing Wands
high above them.</p>

<p>"We come as messengers from the good Queen Zulena,
Ruler of the Fairies," said Zuzu; "and we bring a wish
to you from her, which she wished us to wish on our Royal
Wishing Wands."</p>

<p>"Zulena!" gasped the King, falling back upon the
drapery of his throne with his hand at his throat.
"Zulena!&mdash;is it possible that she&mdash;"</p>
<hr class="tb" />

<p class="caption">The bad Fairy begged for mercy &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Page 187</i></p>
</div>

<hr class="tb" />
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">205</a></span>"O King!" said the Twins together, both rubbing
hard at their Wishing Wands, "this wish has been kept
a secret for many years in the heart of the Queen of the
Fairies. This is the wish: That you be restored to your
former self again; that you cease to value gold as the
greatest of all things; that you remember the friendships
of your earlier days; and that for ever you may
be happy and contented!"</p>

<p>Then to their great surprise a strange and wonderful
thing occurred, directly before their eyes. The form of
the King of Gee-Whiz straightened up. The tired look
faded away from his face. His hair became long and
glossy and dark. His eyes became bright and merry.
His garb grew yet more shining and splendid; and at
once his bearing was that of a young and handsome
man, as indeed he now was. With his hand at the hilt
of his sword, he stepped down from the first step of his
throne, and with a truly royal air raised his hand and
exclaimed: "Long live the Queen Zulena, the Sovereign
to whom I send my homage!"</p>

<p>As he said these words all bowed down before him as
though a strong wind had swept them forward. The King
spoke again.</p>

<p>"My shadow, please!" he said. Without further
speech Zuzu handed him his shadow, recently twisted
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">206</a></span>and distorted, but now new and handsome as the King
himself. To their great surprise it fitted the King perfectly
in every way.</p>

<p>The face of the King was stern and commanding now,
though very handsome and very glad. "My Royal
Cricket now, good Princess," said he to Lulu; "for now
we shall send word of our own to our ruler, the good
Queen who has set us free from all Wicked Fairies."</p>

<p>Lulu bowed low before the King, and presented to
him the White Cricket; which at once took its place
under the shadow of the King. In a moment it had
found a floating film of gossamer, the web of the Fairy
spiders, and the King inclined his ear as he heard a voice
far off chirping.</p>

<p>"That," said the King, "is the telephone to Fairy-land.
And now a royal wish of our own: May the Fairies help
a Monarch who wishes always to be wise and good.
Zulena! Zulena!"</p>

<p>And lo! as they all gazed at the spot where he stood,
to their great surprise they saw standing there, smiling
and bowing and looking very sweet, no less a person than
Zulena, the good Queen of the Fairies.</p>

<p>Kneeling to her, before them all, the King kissed her
hand. The face of the Queen was now very glad and
happy.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">207</a></span>"Now," said the King, rising and again looking very
handsome, and very stern as well as very kind at the
same time, "we, the good Queen Zulena and I, shall rule
this country together from our joint throne. We shall
ever defend the secret of the Fairy Valley where lies the
Mother of Gold. From this time on it shall be our
greatest task to spread abroad content and happiness
for all."</p>

<p>"My lord speaks well and wisely," said the sweet voice
of the Fairy Queen, "and that all may know our wishes
to be the same, I shall grant to each of our subjects here
present, before the Royal Wedding March begins, one
wish each, for that which is best for the one wishing it."</p>

<p>The Court Detective, the Court Physician, and the
Court Lawyer each wished for greater wisdom; and this
the Royal Couple said was a very desirable wish, and
should be granted. The Private Secretary asked that
he might be continued all his life in the service of the
King; and this was granted him, for a better Private
Secretary was never known. The Prince Zuzu, and the
Princess Lulu&mdash;for so they might as well be called at
this time&mdash;each wished that all their friends might be
happy and contented, that the King and Queen might
live and reign for ever and keep Fairy-land a place whence
good children may have good gifts sent to them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">208</a></span>The Widow Pickle made a wish which after all was,
under the circumstances, perhaps quite as practical as
any. "This looks like a wedding," said she, "and I
have not a thing in the world fit to wear. Dear me, I
wish I was back in the city for just a day or so to do
some shopping."</p>

<p>Now, as they all finished their wishes, they looked
about them upon a strange and wondrous scene. The
sun was just sinking and all the earth seemed as though
flooded with gold. The King and Queen stood hand
in hand upon the steps of the throne; and near by, grown
very large, was the Enchanted Banjo, swung high
between two tall trees. Birds came and perched upon
the strings of the Enchanted Banjo, and the wind blew
leaves across the strings; and as they looked at these
things the Enchanted Banjo began to play.</p>
